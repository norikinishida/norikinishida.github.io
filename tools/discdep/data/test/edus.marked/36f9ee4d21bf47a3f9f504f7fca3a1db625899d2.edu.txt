Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses
that cause respiratory , enteric and central nervous system diseases in many species ,
including humans . <S>
Until recently , the relatively low burden of disease in humans
caused by few of these viruses
impeded the development of coronavirus specific therapeutics . <S>
However , the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) , and more recently , Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) , has impelled the development of such drugs . <S>
This review focuses on some newly identified SARS - CoV inhibitors , with known mechanisms of action and their potential
to inhibit the novel MERS - CoV. <S>
The clinical development of optimized versions of such compounds could be beneficial for the treatment and control of SARS - CoV , the current MERS - CoV and other future SARS - like epidemics . <S> <P>
