Rheum palmatum , Chinese traditional herb , exhibits a great variety of anti - cancer and anti - viruses properties . <S>
This study rates antiviral activity of R. palmatum extracts and its components against Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) in vitro . <S>
Methanol extract of R. palmatum contained higher levels of aloe emodin , chrysophanol , rhein , emodin and physcion than water extract . <S>
Methanol extract ( IC 50 = 15.04 lg / ml ) exhibited more potent inhibitory effects on JEV plaque reduction than water extract ( IC 50 = 51.41 lg / ml ) . <S>
Meanwhile , IC 50 values
determined by plaque reduction assay
were 15.82 lg / ml for chrysophanol and 17.39 lg / ml for aloe - emodin , respectively . <S>
Virucidal activity of agents correlated with anti - JEV activity ,
while virucidal IC 50 values were 7.58 lg / ml for methanol extract , 17.36 lg / ml for water extract , 0.75 lg / ml for chrysophanol and 0.46 lg / ml for aloe - emodin , respectively . <S> <P>
In addition , 10 lg / ml of extract , chrysophanol or aloe emodin caused 90 % inhibition of JEV yields in cells
and significantly activated gamma activated sequence - driven promoters . <S>
Hence , methanol extract of R. palmatum and chrysophanol with high therapeutic index might be useful for development of antiviral agents against JEV . <S> <P>
