Pandemics and other crisis situations result in unsettled times , or ontologically insecure moments
when social and political institutions are in flux . <S>
During such crises , the ordinary and unnoticed routines
that structure everyday life
are thrust into the spotlight
as people struggle to maintain or recreate a sense of normalcy . <S>
Drawing on a range of cases
including China , Russia , the UK , and USA ,
we examine three categories of everyday practice during the COVID-19 pandemic
that respond to disruptions in daily routines
and seek a return to national normality :
performing national solidarities and exclusions
by wearing face masks ;
consuming the nation in the form of panic buying and conspiracy theories ;
and enforcing foreign policies through social media and embodiment . <S>
This analysis thus breaks with existing works on everyday nationalism and banal nationalism
that typically focus on pervasively unnoticed forms of nationalism during settled times ,
and it challenges approaches to contentious politics
that predict protest mobilization for change rather than restoration of the status quo ante . <S>
In highlighting the ways
that unsettled times disrupt domestic and international structures ,
this work also presents a first attempt
to link everyday nationalism with growing work on international practices . <S> <P>
