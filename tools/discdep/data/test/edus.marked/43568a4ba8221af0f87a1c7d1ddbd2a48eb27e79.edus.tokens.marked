Objectives of this study were to determine prevalence of infection in feral cats in Northern Florida with a select group of infectious organisms and to determine risk factors for infection . <S>
Blood samples or sera from 553 cats were tested with a panel of antibody , antigen or PCR assays . <S>
Male cats were at higher risk for FIV , Mycoplasma haemofelis , and M. haemominutum . <S>
Infection with either FeLV or FIV was associated with increased risk for coinfection with the other retrovirus , M. haemofelis , or M. haemominutum . <S>
Bartonella henselae had the highest prevalence
and was the only organism
that did not have any associated risk for coinfection with other organisms . <S>
Feral cats in this study had similar or lower prevalence rates of infections than those published for pet cats in the United States . <S>
Thus , feral cats
assessed in this study
appear to be of no greater risk to human beings or other cats than pet cats . <S> <P>
