Shotgun metagenomics
using next generation sequencing ( NGS )
is a promising technique
to analyze both DNA and RNA microbial material from patient samples . <S>
Mostly used in a research setting ,
it is now increasingly being used in the clinical realm as well ,
notably to support diagnosis of viral infections ,
thereby calling for quality control and the implementation of ring trials ( RT )
to benchmark pipelines and ensure comparable results . <S>
The Swiss NGS clinical virology community therefore decided to conduct a RT in 2018 ,
in order to benchmark current metagenomic workflows
used at Swiss clinical virology laboratories ,
and thereby contribute to the definition of common best practices . <S>
The RT consisted of two parts
( increments ) ,
in order to disentangle the variability
arising from the experimental
compared to the bioinformatics parts of the laboratory pipeline . <S>
In addition , the RT was also designed
to assess the impact of databases
compared to bioinformatics algorithms on the final results ,
by asking participants to perform the bioinformatics analysis with a common database ,
in addition to using their own in - house database . <S>
Five laboratories participated in the RT <S>
( seven pipelines were tested ) . <S>
We observed
that the algorithms had a stronger impact on the overall performance than the choice of the reference database . <S>
Our results also suggest
that differences in sample preparation can lead to significant differences in the performance ,
and that laboratories should aim for at least 5 - 10 Mio reads per sample
and use depth of coverage in addition to other interpretation metrics such as the percent of coverage . <S>
Performance was generally lower
when increasing the number of viruses per sample . <S>
The lessons
learned from this pilot study
will be useful for the development of larger - scale RTs
to serve as regular quality control tests for laboratories
performing NGS analyses of viruses in a clinical setting . <S> <P>
