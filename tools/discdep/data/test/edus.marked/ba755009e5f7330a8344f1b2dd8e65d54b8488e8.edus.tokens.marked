Background : <S>
In China , large - scale outbreaks of severe diarrhea
caused by viruses
have occurred in pigs since late 2010 . <S>
To investigate the prevalence and genetic evolution of diarrhea - associated viruses
responsible for the outbreaks ,
a total of 2987 field diarrheal samples
collected from 168 pig farms in five provinces in Southern China during 2012 - 2018
were tested . <S> <P>
Results : <S>
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( PEDV ) was most frequently detected virus with prevalence rates between 50.21 and 62.10 % in samples , and 96.43 % ( 162/168 ) in premises , respectively . <S>
Porcine deltacoronavirus ( PDCoV ) was the second prevalent virus with prevalence rates
ranging from 19.62 to 29.19 % in samples , and 70.24 % ( 118/168 ) in premises , respectively . <S>
Both transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) and porcine rotavirus ( PoRV ) were detected at low prevalence rates of < 3 % in samples and 10.12 % in premises . <S>
In this study , we identified a newly emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus ( SADS - CoV ) in diarrheal samples of piglets from Fujian province in Southern China ,
and the prevalence rate of SADS - CoV was 10.29 % ( 7/68 ) . <S>
Co - infections of these diarrhea - associated viruses were common . <S>
The most frequent co - infection was PEDV with PDCoV , with an average detection rate of 12.72 %
( 380/2987 , ranging from 8.26 - 17.33 % ) . <S>
Phylogenetic analysis revealed
that PEDVs
circulating in Southern China during the last 7 years
were clustered with the variant strains of PEDV in genotype IIa . <S>
The most frequent mutations were present in the collagenase equivalent ( COE ) and epitope regions of the spike gene of the PEDVs
currently circulating in the field . <S>
Genetic relationships of PDCoVs were closely related with Chinese strains , other than those present in the USA , South Korea , Thailand and Lao 's public . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
The findings of this study indicated
that variant PEDV , PDCoV , and SADS - CoV were leading etiologic agents of porcine diarrhea ,
and either mono - infections or co - infections of pathogenic enteric CoVs were common in pigs in Southern China during 2012 - 2018 . <S>
Thus , significant attention should be paid
in order to effectively prevent and control porcine viral diarrhea . <S> <P>
