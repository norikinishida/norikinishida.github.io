The detection of scintillation light from liquid argon is an experimental technique
key to a number of current and future nuclear / particle physics experiments , such as neutrino physics , neutrinoless double beta decay and dark matter searches . <S>
Although the idea of adding small quantities of xenon ( doping )
to enhance the light yield
has attracted considerable interest ,
this technique has never been demonstrated at the necessary scale . <S>
Here we report on xenon doping in a 100 l crogenic vessel . <S>
We observed an increase in light yield by a factor of 1.81±0.04 at a dopant concentration of 10 ppm ,
consistent with a Geant4 prediction of 1.83±0.02 . <S>
We determine a lower limit on the attenuation length of 3 m at a concentration of 10 ppm . <S> <P>
