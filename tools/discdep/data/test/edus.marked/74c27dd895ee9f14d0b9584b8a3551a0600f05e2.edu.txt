Plant artificial micro - RNAs ( amiRs ) have been engineered
to target viral genomes
and induce their degradation . <S>
However , the exceptional evolutionary plasticity of RNA viruses threatens the durability of the resistance
conferred by these amiRs . <S>
It has recently been shown that viral populations
not experiencing strong selective pressure from an antiviral amiR
may already contain enough genetic variability in the target sequence
to escape plant resistance in an almost deterministic manner . <S>
Furthermore , it has also been shown that viral populations
exposed to subinhibitory concentrations of the antiviral amiR
speed up this process . <S>
In this article , we have characterized the molecular evolutionary dynamics of an amiR target sequence in a viral genome under both conditions . <S>
The use of Illumina ultradeep sequencing has allowed us to identify virus sequence variants at frequencies as low as 2 Â 10 À6 and to track their variation in time
before and after the viral population was able of successfully infecting plants fully resistant to the ancestral virus . <S>
We found
that every site in the amiR - target sequence of the viral genome presented variation
and that the variant
that eventually broke resistance
was sampled among the many coexisting ones . <S>
In this system , viral evolution in fully susceptible plants results from an equilibrium between mutation and genetic drift ,
whereas evolution in partially resistant plants originates from more complex dynamics
involving mutation , selection , and drift . <S> <P>
