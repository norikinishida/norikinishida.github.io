Identification of regulatory elements is essential
for understanding the mechanism behind regulating gene expression . <S>
These regulatory elements - located in or near gene - bind to proteins called transcription factors
to initiate the transcription process . <S>
Their occurrences are influenced by the GC - content or nucleotide composition . <S>
For generating synthetic coding sequences with pre - specified amino acid sequence and desired GC - content ,
there exist two stochastic methods , multinomial and maximum entropy . <S>
Both methods rely on the probability of choosing the codon synonymous for usage in regard to a specific amino acid . <S>
In spite the latter exhibited unbiased manner , the produced sequences are not exactly obeying the GC - content constraint . <S>
In this paper , we present an algorithmic solution
to produce coding sequences
that follow exactly a primary amino acid sequence and a desired GC - content . <S>
The proposed tool , namely CodSeqGen , depends on random selection for smaller subsets
to be traversed
using the backtracking approach . <S> <P>
