Viruses have evolved elaborate mechanisms
to evade or inactivate the complex system of sensors and signaling molecules
that make up the host innate immune response . <S>
Here we show
that human coronavirus ( HCoV ) NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) CoV papain - like proteases ( PLP ) antagonize innate immune signaling
mediated by STING
( stimulator of interferon genes , also known as MITA / ERIS / MYPS ) . <S>
STING resides in the endoplasmic reticulum
and upon activation , forms dimers
which assemble with MAVS , TBK-1 and IKKe ,
leading to IRF-3 activation and subsequent induction of interferon ( IFN ) . <S>
We found
that expression of the membrane anchored PLP domain from human HCoV - NL63 ( PLP2-TM ) or SARS - CoV ( PLpro - TM ) inhibits STING - mediated activation of IRF-3 nuclear translocation and induction of IRF-3 dependent promoters . <S>
Both catalytically active and inactive forms of CoV PLPs co - immunoprecipitated with STING , and viral replicase proteins co - localize with STING in HCoV - NL63-infected cells . <S>
Ectopic expression of catalytically active PLP2-TM blocks STING dimer formation
and negatively regulates assembly of STING - MAVS - TBK1 / IKKe complexes
required for activation of IRF-3 . <S>
STING dimerization was also substantially reduced in cells
infected with SARS - CoV. <S>
Furthermore , the level of ubiquitinated forms of STING , RIG - I , TBK1 and IRF-3 are reduced in cells
expressing wild type or catalytic mutants of PLP2-TM ,
likely contributing to disruption of signaling
required for IFN induction . <S>
These results describe a new mechanism
used by CoVs
in which CoV PLPs negatively regulate antiviral defenses
by disrupting the STING - mediated IFN induction . <S> <P>
