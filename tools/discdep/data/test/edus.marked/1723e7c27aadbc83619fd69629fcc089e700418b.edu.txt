The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to consider the physiologic role of obesity in the response to infectious disease . <S>
There are significant disparities in morbidity and mortality by sex , weight and diabetes status . <S>
Numerous endocrine changes might drive these varied responses to SARS - CoV-2 infection
including hormone and immune mediators , hyperglycemia , leukocyte responses , cytokine secretion , and tissue dysfunction . <S>
Studies of patients with severe COVID-19 disease have revealed the importance of innate immune responses
in driving immunopathology and tissue injury . <S>
In this review we will describe the impact of the metabolically induced inflammation ( meta - inflammation )
that characterizes obesity on innate immunity . <S>
We consider
that obesity - driven dysregulation of innate immune responses may drive organ injury in development of severe COVID-19 and impair viral clearance . <S> <P>
