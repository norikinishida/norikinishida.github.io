Newcastle disease ( Paramyxoviridae ) is a highly infectious virus
shed in the faeces of infected birds . <S>
Non - biting Muscid flies characteristically visit manure and decaying organic material
to feed and oviposit ,
and may contribute to disease transmission . <S>
The housefly , Musca domestica ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( Diptera : Muscidae ) , has been implicated as a mechanical vector of numerous pathogens . <S>
In this study 2000 aerial net - captured houseflies were examined for their ability
to harbour Newcastle disease virus ( NDV ) . <S>
In an adjacent study , laboratory - reared flies were experimentally exposed to NDV La Sota strain . <S>
The virus was detected in the dissected gastrointestinal tract of laboratory - exposed flies for up to 72 h post - exposure ,
whereas the untreated control flies were negative . <S> <P>
