The COVID-19 pandemic is the most devastating health emergency
that humans have seen over the past century . <S>
The war against the disease has been handicapped by unavailability of effective therapeutic options . <S>
Till date , there is no clinically approved vaccine or drug for the treatment of COVID-19 ,
and the ongoing search
to find a novel therapy
is progressing at pandemic pace . <S>
Herein , we propose a novel hypothesis
based on sound research evidence
that electric stimulation can be a potential adjuvant to the currently used symptomatic therapies and antiviral drugs . <S>
Based on preclinical evidence ,
we propose
that electric stimulation can improve respiratory functions ,
inhibit SARS - CoV-2 growth ,
reduce pain ,
boost immunity
and improve the penetration of antiviral drugs . <S>
We envisage
that our hypothesis ,
if used clinically as an adjuvant ,
may significantly improve the therapeutic outcomes of the current treatment regimen
being used around the globe for the management of COVID-19 . <S> <P>
