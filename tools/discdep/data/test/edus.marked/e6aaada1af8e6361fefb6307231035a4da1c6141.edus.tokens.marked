The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV-2 ) is a novel coronavirus
first identified in Wuhan , China ,
and the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 . <S>
This infection spreads mainly through direct contact with Fl√ºgge micro droplets or core droplets
that remain suspended as aerosol . <S>
Moreover , it has been reported that infected subjects , both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19 , can transmit the virus . <S>
Since the infection typically enters through mouth , nose , and eyes ,
dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection
due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva . <S>
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has suggested
that only emergency / urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak . <S>
Considering the virus ' route of transmission ,
a specific protocol should be applied
to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures
that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment ( cross - infection ) . <S>
This protocol should be implemented
by modifying both patient management and clinical practice ,
introducing particular devices and organizational practices . <S>
This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice
to reduce infection risk . <S> <P>
