We investigate the difference in the spread of COVID-19 between the states
won by Donald Trump ( Red )
and the states
won by Hillary Clinton ( Blue ) in the 2016 presidential election ,
by mining transportation patterns of US residents from March 2020 to July 2020 . <S>
To ensure a fair comparison ,
we first use a K - means clustering method
to group the 50 states into five clusters
according to their population , area and population density . <S>
We then characterize daily transportation patterns of the residents of different states
using the mean percentage of residents
traveling
and the number of trips per person . <S>
For each state , we study the correlations between travel patterns and infection rate for a 2-month period before and after the official states reopening dates . <S>
We observe
that during the lock - down , Red and Blue states both displayed strong positive correlations between their travel patterns and infection rates . <S>
However ,
after states reopened
we find
that Red states had higher travel - infection correlations than Blue states in all five state clusters . <S>
We find
that the residents of both Red and Blue states displayed similar travel patterns during the period post the reopening of states ,
leading us to conclude
that , on average , the residents in Red states might be mobilizing less safely than the residents in Blue states . <S>
Furthermore , we use temperature data
to attempt to explain the difference in the way
residents travel and practice safety measures . <S> <P>
