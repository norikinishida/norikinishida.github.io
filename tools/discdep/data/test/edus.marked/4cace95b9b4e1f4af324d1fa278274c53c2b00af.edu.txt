We report the design and synthesis of a series of dipeptide - type inhibitors with novel P3 scaffolds
that display potent inhibitory activity against SARS - CoV 3CL pro . <S>
A docking study
involving binding between the dipeptidic lead compound 4 and 3CL pro
suggested the modification of a structurally flexible P3 N-(3methoxyphenyl)glycine with various rigid P3 moieties in 4 . <S>
The modifications led to the identification of several potent derivatives ,
including 5cek and 5n with the inhibitory activities ( K i or IC 50 ) in the submicromolar to nanomolar range . <S>
Compound 5h , in particular , displayed the most potent inhibitory activity , with a K i value of 0.006 mM. <S>
This potency was 65-fold higher than the potency of the lead compound 4 ( K i Â¼ 0.39 mM ) . <S>
In addition , the K i value of 5h was in very good agreement with the binding affinity ( 16 nM )
observed in isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . <S>
A SAR study around the P3 group in the lead 4 led to the identification of a rigid indole-2-carbonyl unit as one of the best P3 moieties ( 5c ) . <S>
Further optimization showed
that a methoxy substitution at the 4-position on the indole unit was highly favorable for enhancing the inhibitory potency . <S> <P>
