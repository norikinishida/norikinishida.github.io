In this demo , we introduce an interactive system ,
which effectively applies multiple criteria analysis
to rank association rules . <S>
We first use association rules techniques
to explore the correlations between variables in given data
( i.e. , database and linked data ( LD ) ) ,
and secondly apply multiple criteria analysis ( MCA )
to select the most relevant rules
according to user preferences . <S>
The developed system is flexible
and allows intuitive creation and execution of different algorithms for an extensive range of advanced data analysis topics . <S>
Furthermore , we demonstrate a case study of association rule mining and ranking on road accident data . <S> <P>
