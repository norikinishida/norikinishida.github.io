This study explores the divergence pattern of SARS - CoV-2
using whole genome sequences of the isolates from various COVID-19 affected countries . <S>
The phylogenomic analysis indicates the presence of at least four distinct groups of the SARS - CoV-2 genomes . <S>
The emergent groups have been found to be associated with signature structural changes in specific proteins . <S>
Also , this study reveals the differential levels of divergence patterns for the protein coding regions . <S>
Moreover , we have predicted the impact of structural changes on a couple of important viral proteins via structural modelling techniques . <S>
This study further advocates for more viral genetic studies with associated clinical outcomes and hosts ' response for better understanding of SARS - CoV-2 pathogenesis
enabling better mitigation of this pandemic situation . <S> <P>
