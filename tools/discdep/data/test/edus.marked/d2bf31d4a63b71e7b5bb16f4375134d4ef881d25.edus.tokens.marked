Studies of SARS coronavirus ( SARS - CoV)
- the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS) -
have been hampered by its high transmission rate and the pathogenicity of this virus . <S>
To permit analysis of the host range and entry mechanism of SARS - CoV ,
we incorporated the humanized SARS - CoV spike ( S ) glycoprotein into HIV particles
to generate a highly infectious SARS - CoV pseudotyped virus . <S>
The infection on Vero E6
- a permissive cell line to SARS - CoV -
could be neutralized by sera from convalescent SARS patients ,
and the entry was a pH - dependent process . <S>
With these highly infectious SARS - CoV pseudotypes , several cell lines
derived from various tissues
were revealed as susceptible to SARS - CoV ,
which were highly corresponding to the expression pattern of virus√ïs receptor angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) . <S>
In addition , we also demonstrated angiotensin 1 converting enzyme ( ACE)
- the homologue of ACE2 could not function as a receptor for SARS - CoV. <S> <P>
