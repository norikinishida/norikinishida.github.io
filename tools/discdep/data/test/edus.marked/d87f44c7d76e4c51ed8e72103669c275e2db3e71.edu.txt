The major physiological function of milk is the transport of amino acids , carbohydrates , lipids and minerals to mammalian offspring . <S>
Caseins , the major milk proteins , are secreted in the form of a micelle
consisting of protein and calciumphosphate . <S>
We have analysed the role of the milk protein a - casein
by inactivating the corresponding gene in mice . <S>
Absence of a - casein protein significantly curtails secretion of other milk proteins and calcium - phosphate ,
suggesting a role for a - casein in the establishment of casein micelles . <S>
In contrast , secretion of albumin ,
which is not synthesized in the mammary epithelium ,
into milk is not reduced . <S>
The absence of a - casein also significantly inhibits transcription of the other casein genes . <S>
a - Casein deficiency severely delays pup growth during lactation
and results in a life - long body size reduction
compared to control animals ,
but has only transient effects on physical and behavioural development of the pups . <S>
The data support a critical role for a - casein in casein micelle assembly . <S>
The results also confirm lactation as a critical window of metabolic programming
and suggest milk protein concentration as a decisive factor
in determining adult body weight . <S> <P>
