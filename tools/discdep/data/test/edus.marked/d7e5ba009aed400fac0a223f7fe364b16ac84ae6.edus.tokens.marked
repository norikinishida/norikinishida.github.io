Next - Generation Sequencing has been used in numerous investigations
to characterize andquantifythe genetic diversity of a virus samplethrough the mapping of polymorphisms and measurement of mutation frequencies . <S>
Next - Generation Sequencing has also been employed
to identifyrecombinationevents
occurring within the genomes of higher organisms ,
for example , detecting alternative RNA splicing events and oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements . <S>
Here , we combine these two approaches toprofile RNA recombination within the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic RNA virus , Flock House Virus . <S>
We detect hundreds of thousands of recombination events , with single - nucleotide resolution ,
which result indiversity in the encapsidated genome
rivaling that due to mismatch mutation . <S>
We detect previously identified Defective - RNAs as well as many other abundant and novel Defective - RNAs . <S>
Our approach is exceptionally sensitive , unbiased ,
and requires no prior knowledge beyond the virus genome sequence . <S>
RNA recombination is a powerful driving force behind the evolution and adaptation of RNA viruses . <S>
The strategy implemented here is widely applicable
and provides a highly detailed description of the complex mutational landscape of the transmissible viral genome . <S> <P>
