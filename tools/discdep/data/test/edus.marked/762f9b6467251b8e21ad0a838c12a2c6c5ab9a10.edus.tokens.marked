Avian infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) is a member of the group III coronaviruses ,
which differ from the other groups of coronaviruses
in that they do not encode the essential pathogenic factor nonstructural protein 1 ( nsp1 )
and instead start with nsp2 . <S>
IBV nsp2 is one of the first replicase proteins
to be translated and processed in the viral life cycle ; <S>
however , it has an entirely unknown function . <S>
In order to better understand the structural details and functional mechanism of IBV nsp2 ,
the recombinant protein was cloned ,
overexpressed in Escherichia coli ,
purified
and crystallized . <S>
The crystals diffracted to 2.8 Å resolution
and belonged to space group P2 1 ,
with unit - cell parameters a = 57.0 , b = 192.3 , c = 105.7 Å , = 90.8 . <S>
Two molecules were found in the asymmetric unit ; <S>
the Matthews coefficient was 3.9 Å 3 Da À1 ,
corresponding to a solvent content of 68.2 % . <S> <P>
