The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS )
caused by SARS coronavirus ( SARS - CoV )
has necessitated an in - depth molecular understanding of the virus
to identify new drug targets . <S>
The availability of complete genome sequence of several strains of SARS virus provides the possibility of identification of protein - coding genes and defining their functions . <S>
Computational approach
to identify protein - coding genes and their putative functions
will help in designing experimental protocols . <S>
Results : <S>
In this paper , a novel analysis of SARS genome
using gene prediction method GeneDecipher
developed in our laboratory
has been presented . <S>
Each of the 18 newly sequenced SARS - CoV genomes has been analyzed
using GeneDecipher . <S>
In addition to polyprotein 1ab 1 , polyprotein 1a and the four genes coding for major structural proteins spike ( S ) , small envelope ( E ) , membrane ( M ) and nucleocapsid ( N ) , six to eight additional proteins have been predicted
depending upon the strain
analyzed . <S>
Their lengths range between 61 and 274 amino acids . <S>
Our method also suggests
that polyprotein 1ab , polyprotein 1a , S , M and N are proteins of viral origin
and others are of prokaryotic . <S>
Putative functions of all predicted protein - coding genes have been suggested
using conserved peptides
present in their open reading frames . <S>
Availability : <S>
Detailed results of GeneDecipher analysis of all the 18 strains of SARS - CoV genomes are available at <S> <P>
