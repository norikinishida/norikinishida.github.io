The development of a " cold - like illness " ( CLI ) usually requires infection with an upper respiratory virus such as rhinovirus , influenza virus , respiratory syncytial virus , parainfluenza virus , coronavirus or adenovirus , among others , and the development of sufficient signs , symptoms and pathophysiologies
to qualify as being ill
based on personal and cultural definitions . <S>
A viral upper respiratory tract infection ( vURTI ) in the absence of overt illness ( subclinical vURTI ) will not be made manifest to the individual or to observers
and , therefore , will not be diagnosed as a CLI . <S>
The degree of illness
occurring during a vURTI
is directly related to the extent of provoked inflammation ,
which in turn depends on the engagement of antiviral defense systems . <S>
Thus , risk factors for CLI can modulate either the vURTI risk
by affecting virus exposure and/or susceptibility to infection ,
or the CLI risk given a vURTI
by affecting immunocompetence , the provoked inflammation and/or the interpretation of illness as a CLI . <S> <P>
In this chapter , we review published studies for evidence of CLI risk - modulating factors
and report
that climate , crowding and perhaps female gender can affect the probability of exposure to vURTI viruses ,
that extant immunological factors and age can affect the probability of virus infection
given exposure ,
that stress levels
( moderated by social environment ) ,
health practices
( exercise , tobacco and alcohol consumption , sleep efficiency )
and genetics contribute to CLI risk
most probably by modulating the immune - inflammatory response to infection ,
and that other factors
such as pollution , home environment and certain personality traits
affect CLI risk
by biasing illness interpretation for a given set of symptoms and signs . <S>
