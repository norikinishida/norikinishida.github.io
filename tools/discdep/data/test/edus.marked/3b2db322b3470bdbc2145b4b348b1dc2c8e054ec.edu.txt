Coronavirus disease 2019
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
has spread rapidly around the world
and is a significant threat to global health . <S>
Patients in the Neonatal Surgery Department have rapidly progressing diseases and immature immunity ,
which makes them vulnerable to pulmonary infection and a relatively higher mortality . <S>
This means
that these patients require multidisciplinary treatment
including early diagnosis , timely transport , emergency surgery and intensive critical care . <S>
The COVID-19 pandemic poses a threat to carrying out these treatments . <S>
To provide support for the health protection requirements of the medical services in the Neonatal Surgery Department ,
we developed recommendations
focusing on patient transport , surgery selection and protection requirements
with the aim of improving treatment strategies for patients
and preventing infection in medical staff during the current COVID-19 pandemic . <S> <P>
