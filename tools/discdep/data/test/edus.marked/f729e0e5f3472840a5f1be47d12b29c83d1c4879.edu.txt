Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world . <S>
Since the effectiveness of the only available tuberculosis vaccine , Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette - Gu√©rin ( BCG ) , is suboptimal ,
there is a strong demand
to develop new tuberculosis vaccines . <S>
As tuberculosis is an airborne disease ,
the intranasal route of vaccination might be preferable . <S>
Live influenza virus vaccines might be considered as potential vectors for mucosal immunization against various viral or bacterial pathogens ,
including M. tuberculosis . <S>
We generated several subtypes of attenuated recombinant influenza A viruses
expressing the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target protein ( ESAT-6 ) of M. tuberculosis from the NS1 reading frame . <S>
We were able to demonstrate the potency of influenza virus NS vectors
to induce an M. tuberculosisspecific Th1 immune response in mice . <S>
Moreover , intranasal immunization of mice and guinea pigs with such vectors induced protection against mycobacterial challenge ,
similar to that
induced by BCG vaccination . <S> <P>
