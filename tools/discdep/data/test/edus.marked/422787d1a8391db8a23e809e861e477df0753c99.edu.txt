Background . <S>
Brazil detected community transmission of COVID-19 on March 13 , 2020 . <S>
In this study we identify
which areas in the country are most vulnerable for COVID-19 , both in terms of the risk of arrival of COVID-19 cases and the risk of sustained transmission . <S>
The micro - regions with higher social vulnerability are also identified . <S> <P>
Methods . <S>
Probabilistic models were used
to calculate the probability of COVID-19 spread from SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , according to previous data available on human mobility in Brazil . <S>
We also perform a multivariate cluster analysis of socio - economic indices
to identify areas with similar social vulnerability . <S> <P>
Results . <S>
The results consist of a series of maps of effective distance , outbreak probability , hospital capacity and social vulnerability . <S>
They show areas in the North and Northeast with high risk of COVID-19 outbreak
that are also highly vulnerable . <S> <P>
