The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify biologically active proteins and to produce them
using biotechnology tools such as bacterial hosts . <S>
However , proteins
produced by Escherichia coli
must be refolded to their native state . <S>
Protein folding liquid chromatography ( PFLC ) is a new method
developed in recent years ,
and it is widely used in molecular biology and biotechnology . <S>
In this paper , the new method , PFLC is introduced
and its recent development is reviewed . <S>
In addition the paper includes definitions , advantages , principles , applications for both laboratory and large scales , apparatus , and effecting factors of PFLC . <S>
In addition , the role of this method in the future is examined . <S> <P>
