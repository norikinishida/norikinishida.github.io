Background : <S>
As the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is a worldwide pandemic ,
and it is rapidly expanding in Iran ,
real - time analyses of epidemiological data are needed to increase situational awareness and inform interventions . <S>
In this study , we built a predictive model
based on the cumulative trend of new cases and deaths for the top five provinces . <S>
We will also look at modeling the trends for confirmed cases , deaths and recovered for the whole country . <S> <P>
Method : <S>
In this study , we have chosen to apply the exponential smoothing model
to iteratively forecast future values of a regular time series from weighted averages of past daily values . <S>
This method is exponential
because the value of each level is influenced by every preceding actual value to an exponentially decreasing degree
-more recent values are given greater weight . <S>
The available data is too small
to identify seasonal patterns
and make a predictable variation in value ,
such as annual fluctuation in temperature
related to the season . <S>
The trend is a tendency of the data to increase or decrease over time . <S> <P>
