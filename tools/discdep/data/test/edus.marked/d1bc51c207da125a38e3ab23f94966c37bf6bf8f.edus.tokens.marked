This paper employs syndemics theory
to explain high rates of sexually transmitted disease among inner city African American and Puerto Rican heterosexual young adults in Hartford , CT , USA . <S>
Syndemic theory helps to elucidate the tendency for multiple co - terminus and interacting epidemics
to develop under conditions of health and social disparity . <S>
Based on enhanced focus group and in - depth interview data ,
the paper argues
that respondents employed a cultural logic of risk assessment
which put them at high risk for STD infection . <S>
This cultural logic was shaped by their experiences
of growing up in the inner city
which included : coming of age in an impoverished family , living in a broken home , experiencing domestic violence , limited expectations of the future , limited exposure to positive role models , lack of expectation of the dependency of others , and fear of intimacy . <S> <P>
