SARS - CoV-2 genetic identification is based on viral RNA extraction prior to RT - qPCR assay ,
however recent studies support the elimination of the extraction step . <S>
Herein , we assessed the RNA extraction necessity ,
by comparing RT - qPCR efficacy in several direct approaches vs. the gold standard RNA extraction ,
in detection of SARS - CoV-2 from laboratory samples as well as clinical Oro - nasopharyngeal SARS - CoV-2 swabs . <S>
Our findings show advantage for the extraction procedure ,
however a direct no - buffer approach might be an alternative ,
since it identified up to 70 % of positive clinical specimens . <S> <P>
