The development of synthetic peptide - based vaccines has many advantages
in comparison with vaccines
based on live attenuated organisms , inactivated or killed organism , or toxins . <S>
Peptide - based vaccines can not revert to a virulent form ,
allow a better conservation ,
and are produced more easily and safely . <S>
However , they generate a weaker immune response than other vaccines ,
and the inclusion of adjuvants and/or the use of vaccine delivery systems is almost always needed . <S>
Among vaccine delivery systems , micro - and nanoparticulated ones are attractive ,
because their particulate nature can increase cross - presentation of the peptide . <S>
In addition , they can be passively or actively targeted to antigen presenting cells . <S>
Furthermore , particulate adjuvants are able to directly activate innate immune system in vivo . <S>
Here , we summarize micro - and nanoparticulated vaccine delivery systems
used in the field of synthetic peptide - based vaccines as well as strategies
to increase their immunogenicity . <S> <P>
