The current Ebola virus outbreak has highlighted the uncertainties
surrounding many aspects of Ebola virus virology ,
including routes of transmission . <S>
The scientific community played a leading role during the outbreak
- potentially , the largest of its kind -
as many of the questions
surrounding ebolaviruses
have only been interrogated in the laboratory . <S>
Scientists provided an invaluable resource for clinicians , public health officials , policy makers , and the lay public
in understanding the progress of Ebola virus disease and the continuing outbreak . <S>
Not all of the scientific communication , however , was accurate or effective . <S>
There were multiple instances of published articles during the height of the outbreak
containing potentially misleading scientific language
that spurred media overreaction
and potentially jeopardized preparedness and policy decisions at critical points . <S>
Here , we use articles
declaring the potential for airborne transmission of Ebola virus
as a case study in the inaccurate reporting of basic science ,
and we provide recommendations
for improving the communication about unknown aspects of disease during public health crises . <S> <P>
Basic scientific research is now considered an integral component of the fight against emerging infectious diseases like Ebola virus . <S>
The recent Ebola outbreak , however , demonstrates
how the ineffective communication of basic science can stoke public panic more
than it provides helpful tools to responders ; <S>
basic science trades in probabilities and uncertainty ,
while public communication tends to favor more categorical claims . <S>
Here , we discuss the ethics
of communicating scientific results ,
using , as a case study , the recent controversy
over whether basic life sciences research demonstrates
that Ebola could become transmissible via airborne respiratory droplet nuclei
- popularly known as a virus
becoming " airborne . " <S>
We show
how the science does not demonstrate this possibility ,
despite claims
made in the popular and scientific press . <S>
We then recommend
that uncertain scientific results in the context of public health crises ought to be communicated with humility , an emphasis on what is unknown , and a clear outline of the kinds of evidence
that would give proof to controversial claims . <S> <P>
