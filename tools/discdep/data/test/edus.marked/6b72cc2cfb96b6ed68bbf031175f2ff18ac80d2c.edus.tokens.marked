Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV-2 ) caused the COVID-19 pandemic
that has been spreading around the world since December 2019 . <S>
More than 10 million affected cases and more than half a million deaths have been reported so far ,
while no vaccine is yet available as a treatment . <S>
Considering the global healthcare urgency ,
several techniques ,
including whole genome sequencing and computed tomography imaging
have been employed
for diagnosing infected people . <S>
Considerable efforts are also directed at detecting and preventing different modes of community transmission . <S>
Among them is the rapid detection of virus presence on different surfaces
with which people may come in contact . <S>
Detection
based on non - contact optical techniques
is very helpful in managing the spread of the virus ,
and to aid in the disinfection of surfaces . <S>
Nanomaterial - based methods are proven suitable for rapid detection . <S>
Given the immense need for science led innovative solutions ,
this manuscript critically reviews recent literature
to specifically illustrate nano - engineered effective and rapid solutions . <S>
In addition , all the different techniques are critically analyzed ,
compared ,
and contrasted
to identify the most promising methods . <S>
Moreover , promising research ideas for high accuracy of detection in trace concentrations , via color change and light - sensitive nanostructures ,
to assist fingerprint techniques
( to identify the virus at the contact surface of the gas and solid phase )
are also presented . <S> <P>
