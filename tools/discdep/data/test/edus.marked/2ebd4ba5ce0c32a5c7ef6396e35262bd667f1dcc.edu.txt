Cytokine storm during viral infection is a prospective predictor of morbidity and mortality ,
yet the cellular sources remain undefined . <S>
Here , using genetic and chemical tools
to probe functions of the S1P 1 receptor ,
we elucidate cellular and signaling mechanisms
that are important in initiating cytokine storm . <S>
Whereas S1P 1 receptor is expressed on endothelial cells and lymphocytes within lung tissue ,
S1P 1 agonism suppresses cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment in wild - type and lymphocyte - deficient mice ,
identifying endothelial cells as central regulators of cytokine storm . <S>
Furthermore , our data reveal immune cell infiltration and cytokine production as distinct events
that are both orchestrated by endothelial cells . <S>
Moreover , we demonstrate
that suppression of early innate immune responses through S1P 1 signaling results in reduced mortality during infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus . <S>
Modulation of endothelium with a specific agonist suggests
that diseases
in which amplification of cytokine storm is a significant pathological component
could be chemically tractable . <S> <P>
