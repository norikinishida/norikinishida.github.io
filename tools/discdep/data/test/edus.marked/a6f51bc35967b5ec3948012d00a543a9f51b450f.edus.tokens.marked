In mammalian cells , the Golgi complex has an elaborate structure
consisting of stacked , flattened cisternal membranes
collected into a ribbon in the center of the cell . <S>
Amazingly , the flattened cisternae can rapidly dilate
to accommodate large cargo
as it traffics through the organelle . <S>
The mechanism
by which this occurs
is unknown . <S>
Exocytosis of large cargo is essential for many physiological processes ,
including collagen and lipoprotein secretion ,
and defects in the process lead to disease . <S>
In addition , enveloped viruses
that bud into the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex
must also be transported through Golgi cisternae for secretion from the infected cell . <S>
This review summarizes our understanding of intra - Golgi transport of large cargo ,
and outlines current questions
open for experimentation . <S> <P>
