The goal of this article is to analyze some compartmental models
specially designed to model the spread of a disease
whose transmission has the same features as COVID-19 . <S>
The major contributions of this article are :
( 1 ) Rigorously find sufficient conditions for the outbreak to only have one peak , i.e. for no second wave of infection to form ;
( 2 ) Investigate the formation of other waves of infection
when such conditions are not met ;
( 3 ) Use numerical simulations
to analyze the different roles
asymptomatic carriers can have . <S>
We also argue
that dividing the population into non - interacting groups leads to an effective reduction of the transmission rates . <S>
As in any compartmental model , the goal of this article is to provide qualitative understanding rather than exact quantitative predictions . <S> <P>
