The HIV-1 frameshift - stimulating ( FSS ) RNA ,
a regulatory RNA of critical importance in the virus ' life cycle ,
has been posited as a novel target for anti - HIV drug development . <S>
We report the synthesis and evaluation of triazole - containing compounds
able to bind the FSS with high affinity and selectivity . <S>
Readily accessible synthetically ,
these compounds are less toxic than previously reported olefin congeners . <S>
We show for the first time
that FSS - targeting compounds have antiviral activity against replication - competent HIV in human cells ,
including a highly cytopathic , multidrug - resistant strain . <S>
These results support the viability of the HIV-1 FSS RNA as a therapeutic target
and more generally highlight opportunities for synthetic molecule - mediated interference with protein recoding in a wide range of organisms . <S> <P>
