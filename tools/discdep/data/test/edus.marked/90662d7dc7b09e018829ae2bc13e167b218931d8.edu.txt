Background : <S>
Human monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs )
generated as a result of the immune response
are likely to be the most effective therapeutic antibodies , particularly in the case of infectious diseases
against which the immune response is protective . <S> <P>
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is an ubiquitous opportunistic virus
that is the most serious pathogenic agent in transplant patients . <S>
The available therapeutic armamentarium
( e.g. HCMV hyperimmune globulins or antivirals )
is associated with severe side effects and the emergence of drug - resistant strains ;
therefore , neutralizing human mAb may be a decisive alternative in the prevention of primary and re - activated HCMV infections in these patients . <S> <P>
The purpose of this study was to generate neutralizing mAb against HCMV from the immunological repertoire of immune donors . <S>
To this aim , we designed an efficient technology
relying on two discrete and sequential steps :
first , human B - lymphocytes are stimulated with TLR9-agonists and IL-2 ;
second ,
after both additives are removed ,
the cells are infected with EBV . <S>
Using this strategy
we obtained 29 clones
secreting IgG
neutralizing the HCMV infectivity ;
four among these were further characterized . <S>
All of the mAbs neutralize the infection in different combinations of HCMV strains and target cells , with a potency ~20 fold higher than that of the HCMV hyperimmune globulins ,
currently used in transplant recipients . <S>
Recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 suitable as a prophylactic or therapeutic tool in clinical applications has been generated . <S> <P>
The technology described has proven to be more reproducible , efficient and rapid than previously reported techniques ,
and can be adopted at low overall costs by any cell biology laboratory for the development of fully human mAbs for immunotherapeutic uses . <S> <P>
