The coronavirus disease 2019 ,
which emerged from Wuhan , China ,
is now a pandemic ,
affecting across the globe . <S>
Government of different countries have developed and adopted various policies
to contain this epidemic
and the most common were the social distancing and lockdown . <S>
We proposed a SEIR epidemic model
that accommodates the effects of lockdown and individual based precautionary measures
and used it
to estimate model parameters from the epidemic data up to 2nd April , 2020 ,
freely available in GitHub repository for COVID-19 , for nine developed and developing countries . <S>
We used the estimated parameters
to predict the disease burden in these countries with special emphasis on India , Bangladesh and Pakistan . <S>
Our analysis revealed
that the lockdown and recommended individual hygiene can slow down the outbreak
but unable to eradicate the disease from the society . <S>
With the current human - to - human transmission rate and existing level of personal precautionary ,
the number of infected individuals in India will be increasing at least for the next 3 months
and the peak will come in 5 months . <S>
We can , however , reduce the epidemic size
and prolong the time
to arrive epidemic peak
by seriously following the measures
suggested by the authorities . <S>
We need to wait for another one month
to obtain more data and epidemiological parameters
for giving a better prediction about the pandemic . <S>
It is to be mentioned that research community is working for drugs and/ or vaccines against COVID19
and the presence of such pharmaceutical interventions will significantly alter the results . <S> <P>
