As intracellular parasites , viruses require a host cell
in order to replicate . <S>
However , they face a series of cellular responses against infection . <S>
One of these responses is the activation of the double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R ( PKR ) . <S>
PKR phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 ( eIF2α ) ,
which in turn results in global protein synthesis inhibition and formation of stress granules ( SGs ) . <S>
Recent studies have shown
that SGs can interfere with the replicative cycle of certain viruses . <S>
This review addresses
how viruses have evolved different control strategies at the SG level
to ensure an efficient replication cycle during the cellular stress response
triggered by the viral infection . <S> <P>
