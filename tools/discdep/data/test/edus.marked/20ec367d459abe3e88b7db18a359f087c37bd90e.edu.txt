Enteroviruses are common human pathogens ,
and infections are particularly frequent in children . <S>
Severe infections can lead to a variety of diseases ,
including poliomyelitis , aseptic meningitis , myocarditis and neonatal sepsis . <S>
Enterovirus infections have also been implicated in asthmatic exacerbations and type 1 diabetes . <S>
The large disease spectrum of the closely related enteroviruses may be partially , but not fully , explained by differences in tissue tropism . <S>
The molecular mechanisms
by which enteroviruses cause disease
are poorly understood ,
but there is increasing evidence
that the two enteroviral proteases , 2A pro and 3C pro , are important mediators of pathology . <S>
These proteases perform the posttranslational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein ,
but they also cleave several host - cell proteins
in order to promote the production of new virus particles ,
as well as to evade the cellular antiviral immune responses . <S>
Enterovirus - associated processing of cellular proteins may also contribute to pathology ,
as elegantly demonstrated by the 2A pro -mediated cleavage of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes
contributing to Coxsackievirus - induced cardiomyopathy . <S>
It is likely that improved tools
to identify targets for these proteases
will reveal additional host protein substrates
that can be linked to specific enterovirus - associated diseases . <S>
Here , we discuss the function of the enteroviral proteases in the virus replication cycle
and review the current knowledge
regarding how these proteases modulate the infected cell
in order to favour virus replication ,
including ways
to avoid detection by the immune system . <S>
We also highlight new possibilities for the identification of protease - specific cellular targets and thereby a way
to discover novel mechanisms
contributing to disease . <S> <P>
