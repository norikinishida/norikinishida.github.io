The computational search of chemical libraries has been used as a powerful tool for the rapid discovery of candidate compounds . <S>
To find small molecules with anti - feline infectious peritonitis virus ( FIPV ) properties ,
we utilized a virtual screening technique
to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds . <S>
The protease 3CL ( 3CL pro ) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family Coronaviridae . <S>
The 15 best - ranked candidate consensus compounds ,
based on three docking tools ,
were evaluated for further assays . <S>
The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CL pro was performed
to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC 50
ranging from 6.36 ± 2.15 to 78.40 ± 2.60 μM. <S>
As determined by the cell - based assay ,
the compounds NSC345647 , NSC87511 , and NSC343256 showed better EC 50 values than the broad - spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir , under all the test conditions
including pre - viral entry , post - viral entry , and prophylactic activity . <S>
The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index
( > 4 ; range of SI = 13.80 - 22.90 ) . <S>
These results indicated
that the natural small - molecular compounds specifically targeted the 3CL pro of FIPV
and inhibited its replication . <S>
Structural modification of these compounds may generate a higher anti - viral potency for the further development of a novel therapy against FIP . <S> <P>
