A Resequencing Pathogen Microarray ( RPM ) is a single , highly multiplexed assay
for detecting and differentiating similarly related pathogens
by using closely overlapping probe sets
to determine a target organism 's nucleotide sequence . <S>
In this study , a new RPM ( RPM - IVDC1 )
that consisted of 224-bp detector tiles
corresponding to 9 influenza A subtypes , 11 rhinoviruses , 28 enteroviruses and 38 other respiratory viruses
was developed and optimized
to provide individual and simultaneous detection sensitivities
ranging from 15 to 750 genomic copies for 16 common respiratory pathogens . <S>
A total of 110 consecutive patients with community - acquired pneumonia ( CAP )
admitted to 5 district general hospitals in Beijing during a 1-year period
were assessed using the new assay . <S>
Among the children ( under age 5 ) and adult patients ( above age 18 ) , respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) and rhinovirus ( RV ) were the most common etiological agents , respectively ,
which is consistent with reference assays . <S>
Atypical pathogens that may cause CAP - like illness ,
including rubella virus , measles virus , influenza type C virus , human herpesvirus ( HHV )
were also detected . <S>
The results show the capability of RPM - IVDC1 for the accurate detection and identification of multiple virus types ,
which may be of significant use in epidemic surveillance and outbreak investigations of atypical pathogens . <S> <P>
