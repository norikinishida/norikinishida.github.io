Canine parvovirus ( CPV ) is the number one viral cause of enteritis , morbidity , and mortality in 8-week - old young puppies . <S>
We have developed twin assays
( slide agglutination test [ SAT ] for CPV antigen and slide inhibition test [ SIT ] for CPV antibody )
that are sensitive , specific , cost - effective , generic for all genotypes of CPV ,
and provide instant results for CPV antigen detection in feces and antibody quantification in serum . <S>
We found these assays to be useful for routine applications in kennels with large numbers of puppies at risk . <S>
The results of these assays are available in 1 min
and do not require any special instrumentation . <S>
SAT - SIT technology will find applications in rapid screening of samples for other hemagglutinating emerging viruses of animals and humans
( influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ) . <S> <P>
