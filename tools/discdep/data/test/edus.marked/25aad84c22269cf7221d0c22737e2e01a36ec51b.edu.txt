RNA dependent DNA - polymerases , reverse transcriptases , are key enzymes for retroviruses and retroelements . <S>
Their fidelity ,
including indel generation ,
is significant for their use as reagents
including for deep sequencing . <S>
Here , we report
that certain RNA template structures and G - rich sequences , ahead of diverse reverse transcriptases can be strong stimulators for slippage at slippageprone template motif sequence 3 of such ' slippagestimulatory ' structures . <S>
Where slippage is stimulated ,
the resulting products have one or more additional base(s )
compared to the corresponding template motif . <S>
Such structures also inhibit slippagemediated base omission
which can be more frequent in the absence of a relevant stem - loop . <S>
Slippage directionality , base insertion and omission , is sensitive to the relative concentration ratio of dNTPs
specified by the RNA template slippage - prone sequence and its 5 adjacent base . <S>
The retrotransposon - derived enzyme TGIRT exhibits more slippage in vitro than the retroviral enzymes
tested
including that from HIV . <S>
Structure - mediated slippage may be exhibited by other polymerases and enrich gene expression . <S>
A cassette from Drosophila retrotransposon Dme1 chrX 2630566 , a candidate
for utilizing slippage for its GagPol synthesis ,
exhibits strong slippage in vitro . <S>
Given the widespread occurrence and importance of retrotransposons ,
systematic studies
to reveal the extent of their functional utilization of RT slippage
are merited . <S> <P>
