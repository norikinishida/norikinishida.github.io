Emerging and re - emerging infectious diseases , and their determinants , have recently attracted substantial scientific and popular attention . <S>
HIV / AIDS , severe acute respiratory syndrome , H5N1 avian influenza , and many other emerging diseases have either proved fatal
or caused international alarm . <S>
Common and interactive co - determinants of disease emergence ,
including population growth , travel , and environmental disruption ,
have been increasingly documented
and studied . <S>
Are emerging infections a new phenomenon
related to modern life ,
or do more basic determinants , transcending time , place , and human progress , govern disease generation ? <S>
By examining a number of historically notable epidemics ,
we suggest
that emerging diseases ,
similar in their novelty , impact , and elicitation of control responses ,
have occurred throughout recorded history . <S>
Fundamental determinants ,
typically acting in concert ,
seem to underlie their emergence ,
and infections such as these are likely to continue to remain challenges to human survival . <S> <P>
