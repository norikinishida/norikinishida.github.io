BACKGROUND : <S>
Evaluation of interindividual variability is a challenging step in risk assessment . <S>
For most environmental pollutants ,
including perchloroethylene ( PERC ) ,
experimental data are lacking ,
resulting in default assumptions
being used
to account for variability in toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics . <S>
OBJECTIVE : <S>
We quantitatively examined the relationship between PERC toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level
to test
whether individuals with increased oxidative metabolism are be more sensitive to hepatotoxicity
following PERC exposure . <S>
METHODS : <S>
Male mice from 45 strains of the Collaborative Cross ( CC ) were orally administered a single dose of PERC ( 1,000 mg / kg ) or vehicle ( Alkamuls - EL620 )
and euthanized at various time points ( n = 1 = strain = time ) . <S>
Concentration - time profiles were generated for PERC and its primary oxidative metabolite trichloroacetate ( TCA ) in multiple tissues . <S>
Toxicodynamic phenotyping was also performed . <S>
RESULTS : <S>
Significant variability among strains was observed in toxicokinetics of PERC and TCA in every tissue examined . <S>
Based on area under the curve ( AUC ) ,
the range of liver TCA levels spanned nearly an order of magnitude ( âˆ¼ 8-fold ) . <S>
Expression of liver cytochrome P4502E1 did not correlate with TCA levels . <S>
Toxicodynamic phenotyping revealed an effect of PERC on bodyweight loss , induction of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor - alpha ( PPARa)-regulated genes , and dysregulation of hepatic lipid homeostasis . <S>
Clustering was observed among a ) liver levels of PERC , TCA , and triglycerides ; b ) TCA levels in liver and kidney ; and c ) TCA levels in serum , brain , fat , and lung . <S>
CONCLUSIONS : <S>
Using the CC mouse population model ,
we have demonstrated a complex and highly variable relationship between PERC and TCA toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics at the population level . <S>
