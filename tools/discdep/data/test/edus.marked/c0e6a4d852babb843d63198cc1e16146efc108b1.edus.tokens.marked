The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) 3a locus encodes a 274 a.a . novel protein ,
and its expression has been confirmed in SARS patients . <S>
To study functional roles of 3a ,
we established a transgenic fly model for the SARS - CoV 3a gene . <S>
Misexpression of 3a in Drosophila caused a dominant rough eye phenotype . <S>
Using a specific monoclonal antibody ,
we demonstrated
that the 3a protein displayed a punctate cytoplasmic localization in Drosophila as in SARS - CoV - infected cells . <S>
We provide genetic evidence
to support
that 3a is functionally related to clathrin - mediated endocytosis . <S>
We further found
that 3a misexpression induces apoptosis ,
which could be modulated by cellular cytochrome c levels and caspase activity . <S>
From a forward genetic screen , 78 dominant 3a modifying loci were recovered
and the identity of these modifiers revealed
that the severity of the 3a - induced rough eye phenotype depends on multiple cellular processes
including gene transcriptional regulation . <S> <P>
