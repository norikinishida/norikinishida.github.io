In this study , we investigated turkey reovirus ( TReoV ) in tissue samples from young birds ,
aged 15 days . <S>
RT - PCR for TReoV detected 3.3 % positive samples and TReoV was successfully isolated in Vero cells . <S>
Histological analysis of positive bursa of Fabricius ( BF ) revealed atrophied follicles and lymphocyte depletion . <S>
The number of CD8 ? , CD4 ? and IgM ? cells was lower in infected BF . <S>
Phylogenetic analysis
based on S3 gene
showed
that the Brazilian TReoV isolates clustered in a single group with 98 - 100 % similarity to TReoV strains
circulating in the United States . <S>
This is the first indication
that TReoV infection may be a contributing factor to immunosuppression in young birds . <S> <P>
