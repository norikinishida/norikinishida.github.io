This paper offers a state - of - the - art overview of the intertwined privacy , confidentiality , and security issues
that are commonly encountered in health research
involving disaggregate geographic data about individuals . <S>
Key definitions are provided , along with some examples of actual and potential security and confidentiality breaches and related incidents
that captured mainstream media and public interest in recent months and years . <S>
The paper then goes on to present a brief survey of the research literature on location privacy / confidentiality concerns and on privacy - preserving solutions in conventional health research and beyond ,
touching on the emerging privacy issues
associated with online consumer geoinformatics and location - based services . <S>
The ' missing ring ' ( in many treatments of the topic ) of data security is also discussed . <S>
Personal information and privacy legislations in two countries , Canada and the UK , are covered , as well as some examples of recent research projects and events about the subject . <S>
Select highlights from a June 2009 URISA ( Urban and Regional Information Systems Association ) workshop entitled ' Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality of Geographic Data in Health Research ' are then presented . <S>
The paper concludes
by briefly charting the complexity of the domain and the many challenges
associated with it ,
and proposing a novel , ' one stop shop ' case - based reasoning framework
to streamline the provision of clear and individualised guidance for the design and approval of new research projects
( involving geographical identifiers about individuals ) ,
including crisp recommendations
on which specific privacy - preserving solutions and approaches would be suitable in each case . <S> <P>
