Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is a DNA virus
that infects the liver as primary target . <S>
Currently , a high affinity receptor for HBV is still unknown . <S>
The dendritic cell specific C - type lectin DC - SIGN is involved in pathogen recognition through mannose and fucose
containing carbohydrates
leading to the induction of an anti - viral immune response . <S>
Many glycosylated viruses subvert this immune surveillance function
and exploit DC - SIGN as a port of entry and for trans - infection of target cells . <S>
The glycosylation pattern on HBV surface antigens ( HBsAg ) together with the tissue distribution of HBV would allow interaction between HBV and DC - SIGN and its liver - expressed homologue L - SIGN . <S>
Therefore , a detailed study
to investigate the binding of HBV to DC - SIGN and L - SIGN
was performed . <S>
For HCV , both DC - SIGN and L - SIGN are known to bind envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2 . <S>
Soluble DC - SIGN and L - SIGN specifically bound HCV virus - like particles ,
but no interaction with either HBsAg or HepG2.2.15-derived HBV was detected . <S>
Also , neither DC - SIGN nor L - SIGN transfected Raji cells bound HBsAg . <S>
In contrast , highly mannosylated HBV ,
obtained
by treating HBV producing HepG2.2.15 cells with the a - mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine ,
is recognized by DC - SIGN . <S>
The a - mannosidase I trimming of N - linked oligosaccharide structures thus prevents recognition by DC - SIGN . <S>
On the basis of these findings , it is tempting to speculate
that HBV exploits mannose trimming as a way
to escape recognition by DC - SIGN
and thereby subvert a possible immune activation response . <S> <P>
