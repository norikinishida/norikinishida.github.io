The entry of two dengue virus ( DENV ) serotypes into Vero cells was analysed
using biochemical inhibitors , dominant negative mutants of cellular proteins
involved in endocytic pathways ,
fluorescence microscopy and infectivity determinations . <S>
By treatment with dansylcadaverine and chlorpromazine and overexpression of a dominant negative form of the Eps15 protein ,
a clathrin - mediated endocytosis for productive DENV-1 internalization into Vero cells was demonstrated
whereas the infectious entry of DENV-2 in the same cell system was independent of clathrin . <S>
Treatment with the inhibitors nystatin and methyl - b - cyclodextrin , as well as transfection of Vero cells with dominant negative caveolin-1 , had no effect on DENV-2 virus infection . <S>
It was also shown ,
by using the K44A mutant and the inhibitor dynasore ,
that dynamin was required for DENV-2 entry . <S>
Consequently , the infectious entry of DENV-2 into Vero cells occurs by a non - classical endocytic pathway
independent of clathrin , caveolae and lipid rafts ,
but dependent on dynamin . <S>
By contrast , DENV-2 entry into A549 cells was clathrin - dependent ,
as previously reported in HeLa , C6/36 and BS - C-1 cells . <S>
Our results conclusively show , for the first time , a differential mode of infective entry for DENV-1 and DENV-2 into a common host cell , Vero cells , as well as alternative entry pathways for a given serotype , DENV-2 , into different types of cells . <S> <P>
