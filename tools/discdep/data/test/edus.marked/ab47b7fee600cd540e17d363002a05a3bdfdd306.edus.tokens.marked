Current research is an attempt
to understand the CoVID-19 pandemic curve through statistical approach of probability density function with associated skewness and kurtosis measures , change point detection and polynomial fitting
to estimate infected population along with 30 days projection . <S>
The pandemic curve has been explored for above average affected countries , six regions and global scale during 64 days of 22nd January to 24th March , 2020 . <S>
The global cases infection as well as recovery rate curves remained in the ranged of 0 -9.89 and 0 -8.89 % , respectively . <S>
The confirmed cases probability density curve is high positive skewed and leptokurtic with mean global infected daily population of 6620 . <S>
The recovered cases showed bimodal positive skewed curve of leptokurtic type with daily recovery of 1708 . <S>
The change point detection helped to understand the CoVID-19 curve in term of sudden change in term of mean or mean with variance . <S>
This pointed out
disease curve is consist of three phases and last segment
that varies in term of day lengths . <S>
The mean with variance based change detection is better in differentiating phases and associated segment length as compared to mean . <S>
Global infected population might rise in the range of 0.750 to 4.680 million by 24 th April 2020 ,
depending upon the pandemic curve progress beyond 24th March , 2020 . <S>
Expected most affected countries will be USA , and UK with at least infected population of over 0.100 million . <S>
Infected population polynomial projection errors remained in the range of -78.8 to 49.0 % . <S> <P>
