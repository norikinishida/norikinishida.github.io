The integration of proteomic methods to virology has facilitated a significant breadth of biological insight into mechanisms of virus replication , antiviral host responses and viral subversion of host defenses . <S>
Throughout the course of infection , these cellular mechanisms rely heavily on the formation of temporally and spatially regulated virus - host protein - protein interactions . <S>
Reviewed here are proteomic - based approaches
that have been used
to characterize this dynamic virus - host interplay . <S>
Specifically discussed are the contribution of integrative mass spectrometry , antibodybased affinity purification of protein complexes , cross - linking and protein array techniques
for elucidating complex networks of virus - host protein associations during infection with a diverse range of RNA and DNA viruses . <S>
The benefits and limitations
of applying proteomic methods to virology
are explored ,
and the contribution of these approaches to important biological discoveries and to inspiring new tractable avenues for the design of antiviral therapeutics is highlighted . <S> <P>
