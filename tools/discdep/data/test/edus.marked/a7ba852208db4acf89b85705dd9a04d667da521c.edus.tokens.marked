Norovirus is a major etiologic agent in worldwide outbreaks of gastroenteritis
associated with food as well as person - to - person transmission . <S>
The ubiquitous nature of Norovirus necessitates simple and rapid detection methods with high accuracy and sensitivity . <S>
To this end , several investigators have evaluated the usefulness of commercial reverse - transcription loop - mediated isothermal amplification ( RT - LAMP ) kits
for detecting Norovirus genogroups I ( GI ) and II ( GII ) . <S>
In previous studies , the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII showed a relatively high detection rate ,
while that for Norovirus GI showed a relatively low detection rate . <S>
In the present study , clinical Norovirus specimens were used
to compare the detection rate of a modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI with the rates of the conventional Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI and an ' ' in - house ' ' RT - LAMP GI primer set ,
methods
which had a high detection rate . <S>
Results from the present study showed
that the modified Loopamp kit for Norovirus GI had a higher detection rate for two viral genotypes ( GI.3 , GI.11 ) . <S>
On comparison with an ' ' in - house ' ' GII primer set
using genotype GII.4 viruses
circulating recently ,
the detection rate by the Loopamp kit for Norovirus GII was found to be higher , with a 98 % detection rate . <S>
These results indicate the applicability of the modified LAMP kit for GI and the conventional LAMP kit for GII for detection of Noroviruses in clinical samples . <S> <P>
