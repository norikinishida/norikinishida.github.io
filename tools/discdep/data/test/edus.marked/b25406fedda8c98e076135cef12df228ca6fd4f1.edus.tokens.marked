The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to the manufacturing of novel devices
to protect clinicians from the risk of transmission ,
including the aerosol box for use during tracheal intubation . <S>
We evaluated the impact of two aerosol boxes
( an early - generation box and a latest - generation box )
on intubations in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 with an in - situ simulation crossover study . <S>
The simulated process complied with the Safe Airway Society coronavirus disease 2019 airway management guidelines . <S>
The primary outcome was intubation time ;
secondary outcomes included first - pass success and breaches to personal protective equipment . <S>
All intubations were performed by specialist ( consultant ) anaesthetists and video recorded . <S>
Twelve anaesthetists performed 36 intubations . <S>
Intubation time with no aerosol box was significantly shorter than with the early - generation box
( median ( IQR [ range ] ) 42.9 ( 32.9 - 46.9 [ 30.9 - 57.6])s vs. 82.1 ( 45.1 - 98.3 [ 30.8 - 180.0])s p = 0.002 )
and the latest - generation box
( 52.4 ( 43.1 - 70.3 [ 35.7 - 169.2])s , p = 0.008 ) . <S>
No intubations without a box took more than 1 min ,
whereas 14
( 58 % )
intubations with a box took over 1 min
and 4
( 17 % )
took over 2 min
( including one failure ) . <S>
Without an aerosol box , all anaesthetists obtained first - pass success . <S>
With the early - generation and latest - generation boxes ,
9
( 75 % )
and
10
( 83 % )
participants obtained first - pass success , respectively . <S> <P>
