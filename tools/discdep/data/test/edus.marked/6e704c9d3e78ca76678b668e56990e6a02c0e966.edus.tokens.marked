We argue
that the incentive structure of all individual and coordinated measures across countries
to contain the corona - pandemic
is that of a weakest - link public good game . <S>
We discuss a selection of theoretical and experimental key results of weakest - link games
and interpret them in the light of the corona - pandemic . <S>
First , we highlight
that experimental evidence does not support the assumption
that coordination can be trivially solved , even among symmetric players . <S>
Second , we argue
that for asymmetric countries the weakest - link game does not only pose a problem of coordination ,
but also a problem of cooperation . <S>
Third , we show
how and under which conditions self - enforcing treaties can foster coordination and cooperation . <S>
We account for the possibility
that countries make mistakes
when choosing their actions . <S>
Our discussion shows
that North - South cooperation is relevant
and likely to be self - enforcing
and that regional cooperation ,
e.g. , within the EU ,
will also be important . <S> <P>
