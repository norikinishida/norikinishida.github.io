A number of methods
based on the deep learning
have been applied to medical image segmentation
and have achieved state - of - the - art performance . <S>
Due to the importance of chest x - ray data
in studying COVID-19 ,
there is a demand for state - of - art models
capable of precisely segmenting chest x - rays
before obtaining mask annotations about this sort of dataset . <S>
The dataset
for exploring best pre - trained model
is from Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital
which had opened in 2014 . <S>
The most famous technique is U - Net
which has been used to many medical datasets
including the Chest X - ray . <S>
However , most of variant U - Net mainly focus on extraction of contextual information and dense skip connection . <S>
There is still a large space for improving extraction of spatial feature . <S>
In this paper , we propose a dual encoder fusion U - Net framework for Chest X - rays
based on Inception Convolutional Neural Network with dilation , Densely Connected Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network ,
which is named DEFU - Net . <S>
The densely connected recurrent path extends the network deeper
for facilitating context feature extraction . <S>
In order to increase the width of network
and enrich representation of features ,
the inception blocks with dilation have been used . <S>
The inception blocks can capture globally and locally spatial information by various receptive fields . <S>
Meanwhile , the features fusion of two path by summation preserve the context and the spatial information for decoding part . <S>
This multi - learning - scale model are benefiting in Chest X - ray dataset from two different manufacturers
( Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital ) . <S>
The DEFU - Net achieves the better performance than basic U - Net , residual U - Net , BCDU - Net , modified R2U - Net and modified attention R2U - Net . <S>
This model is proved the feasibility for mixed dataset . <S>
The open source code for this proposed framework will be public soon . <S> <P>
