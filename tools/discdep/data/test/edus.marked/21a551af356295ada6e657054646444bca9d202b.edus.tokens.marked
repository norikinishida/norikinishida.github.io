This review summarizes the current knowledge on the physiological action of endogenous and exogenous pulmonary surfactant , the role of different types of animal - derived and synthetic surfactants for RDS therapy , different modes of administration , potential risks and strategies of ventilation , and highlights the most promising aims for future development . <S>
Scientists have clarified the physicochemical properties and functions of the different components of surfactant ,
and part of this successful research is derived from the characterization of genetic diseases
affecting surfactant composition or function . <S>
Knowledge from functional tests of surfactant action , its immunochemistry , kinetics and homeostasis are important
also for improving therapy with animal - derived surfactant preparations
and for the development of modified surfactants . <S>
In the past decade newly designed artificial surfactants and additives have gained much attention
and have proven different advantages ,
but their particular role still has to be defined . <S> <P>
