Cases of COVID-19 are escalating rapidly across the globe , with the mortality risk being especially high among those with existing illness and multimorbidity . <S>
This study aimed to synthesise evidence for the role and response of palliative care and hospice teams to viral epi / pandemics ,
to inform the COVID-19 pandemic response . <S> <P>
We conducted a rapid systematic review
according to PRISMA guidelines in five databases . <S>
Of 3094 papers identified , ten were included in this narrative synthesis . <S> <P>
Included studies were from West Africa , Taiwan , Hong Kong , Singapore , the United States and Italy . <S>
All had an observational design . <S>
Findings were synthesised
using a previously proposed framework
according to ' systems ' ( policies , training and protocols , communication and coordination , data ) , ' staff ' ( deployment , skill mix , resilience ) , ' space ' ( community provision , use of technology ) and ' stuff ' ( medicines and equipment , personal protective equipment ) . <S>
We conclude
that hospice and palliative services have an essential role in the response to COVID-19 by :
1 ) responding rapidly and flexibly ;
2 ) ensuring protocols for symptom management are available , and training non - specialists in their use ;
3 ) being involved in triage ;
4 ) considering shifting resources into the community ;
5 ) considering redeploying volunteers to provide psychosocial and bereavement care ;
6 ) facilitating camaraderie among staff
and adopt measures to deal with stress ;
7 ) using technology
to communicate with patients and carers ;
8) adopting standardised data collection systems
to inform operational changes
and improve care . <S> <P>
