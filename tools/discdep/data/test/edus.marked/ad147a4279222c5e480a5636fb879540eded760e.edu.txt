The epidemic threshold of the susceptible - infected - recovered model is a boundary
separating parameters
that permit epidemics from those
that do not . <S>
This threshold corresponds to parameters
where the system 's equilibrium becomes unstable . <S>
Consequently , we use the average rate
at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink
to define a distance to this threshold . <S>
However , the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly
even when transmission is far from threshold levels . <S>
Here , we show analytically
how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population . <S>
Although these results are exact only in the limit of long - term observation of a large system ,
simulations show
that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes , environmental noise and observation schemes . <S>
Having established some guidelines
about when estimates are accurate ,
we then illustrate
how multiple distance estimates can be used
to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold . <S>
The estimation approach is general
and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens
such as Middle East respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) as well as vaccine - preventable diseases like measles . <S> <P>
