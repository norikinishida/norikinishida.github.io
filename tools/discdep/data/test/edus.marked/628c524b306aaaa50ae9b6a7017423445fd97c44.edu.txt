Background : <S>
Anecdotal reports of mood disorder
following infection with common respiratory viruses with neurotropic potential
have been in existence since the last century . <S>
Nevertheless , systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking . <S>
Methods : <S>
Influenza A , B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls , by SCID . <S>
Pearson 's χ² tests and logistic regression models were used
to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses , influenza A and B viruses and the following :
a ) history of recurrent mood disorders b ) having attempted suicide in the past c ) uni - vs . bi - polarity and d ) presence of psychotic symptoms during mood episodes . <S>
Results : <S>
Seropositivity for influenza A
( p = 0.004 ) ,
B
( p b 0.0001 )
and coronaviruses
( p b 0.0001 )
were associated with history of mood disorders but not with the specific diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depression . <S>
Seropositivity for influenza B was significantly associated with a history of suicide attempt
( p = 0.001 )
and history of psychotic symptoms
( p = 0.005 ) . <S>
Limitations : <S>
The design was cross - sectional . <S>
Socioeconomic factors , inflammatory markers , and axis II psychopathology were not assessed . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
The association of seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses with a history of mood disorders , and influenza B with suicidal behavior require replication in larger longitudinal samples . <S>
The need for these studies is additionally supported by the high incidence of these viral infections , the high prevalence of mood disorders , and resilience of suicide epidemics . <S> <P>
