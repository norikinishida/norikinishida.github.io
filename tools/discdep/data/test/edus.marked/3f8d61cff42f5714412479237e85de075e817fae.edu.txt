Porcine Î² - defensin 2 ( PBD-2 ) ,
expressed by different tissues of pigs ,
is a multifunctional cationic peptide with antimicrobial , immunomodulatory and growth - promoting abilities . <S>
As the latest generation of genome - editing tool , CRISPR / Cas9 system makes it possible to enhance the expression of PBD-2 in pigs by site - specific knock - in of pbd-2 gene into the pig genome . <S>
In this study , we aimed to generate marker - free pbd-2 knock - in pigs
using the CRISPR / Cas9 and Cre / loxP systems . <S>
Two copies of pbd-2 gene
linked by a T2A sequence
were inserted into the porcine Rosa26 locus through CRISPR / Cas9-mediated homology - directed repair . <S>
The floxed selectable marker gene neoR ,
used for G418 screening of positive cell clones ,
was removed by cell - penetrating Cre recombinase with a recombination efficiency of 48.3 % . <S>
Cloned piglets were produced via somatic cell nuclear transfer
and correct insertion of pbd-2 genes was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot . <S>
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses indicated
that expression levels of PBD-2 in different tissues of transgenic ( TG ) piglets were significantly higher than those of their wild - type ( WT ) littermates . <S>
Bactericidal assays demonstrated
that there was a significant increase in the antimicrobial properties of the cell culture supernatants of porcine ear fibroblasts from the TG pigs
in comparison to those from the WT pigs . <S>
Altogether , our study improved the protein expression level of PBD-2 in pigs by site - specific integration of pbd-2 into the pig genome ,
which not only provided an effective pig model
to study the anti - infection mechanisms of PBD-2
but also a promising genetic material for the breeding of disease - resistant pigs . <S> <P>
