Mucosal vaccination is an effective strategy
for generating antigen - specific immune responses against mucosal infections of foot - and - mouth disease virus ( FMDV ) . <S>
In this study , Lactobacillus plantarum strains NC8 and WCFS1 were used as oral delivery vehicles
containing a pSIP411-VP1 recombinant plasmid
to initiate mucosal and systemic immune responses in guinea pigs . <S>
Guinea pigs were orally vaccinated
( three doses )
with NC8-pSIP411 , NC8-pSIP411-VP1 , WCFS1-pSIP411 , WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 or milk . <S>
Animals
immunized with NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1
developed high levels of antigen - specific serum IgG , IgA , IgM , mucosal secretory IgA ( sIgA ) and neutralizing antibodies ,
and revealed stronger cell - mediated immune responses
and enhanced protection against FMDV challenge
compared with control groups . <S>
The recombinant pSIP411-VP1 effectively improved immunoprotection against FMDV in guinea pigs . <S> <P>
