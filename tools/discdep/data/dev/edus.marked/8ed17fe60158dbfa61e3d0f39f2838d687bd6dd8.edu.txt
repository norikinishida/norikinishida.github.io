A novel coronavirus ( CoV )
that causes a severe lower respiratory tract infection in humans ,
emerged in the Middle East region in 2012 . <S>
This virus ,
named Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS)-CoV ,
is phylogenetically related to bat CoVs ,
but other animal species like dromedary camels may potentially act as intermediate hosts
by spreading the virus to humans . <S>
Although human to human transmission has been demonstrated ,
analysis of human MERS clusters indicated
that chains of transmission were not self - sustaining ,
especially when infection control was implemented . <S>
Thus , timely identification of new MERS cases
followed by their quarantine ,
combined with measures
to limit spread of the virus from the ( intermediate ) host to humans ,
may be crucial
in controlling the outbreak of this emerging CoV. <S> <P>
