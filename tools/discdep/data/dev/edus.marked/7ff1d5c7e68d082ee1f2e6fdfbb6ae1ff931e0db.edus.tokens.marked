COVID-19 can affect the hematopoietic system . <S>
Thrombocytopenia at admission was prevalent ,
while late - phase or delayed - phase thrombocytopenia
( occurred 14 days after symptom onset )
is obscure . <S>
This retrospective single - center study screened 450 COVID-19 patients
and enrolled 271 patients at the Union Hospital , Wuhan , China , from January 25th to March 9th , 2020 . <S>
COVID-19 associated delayed - phase thrombocytopenia occurred in 11.8 % percent of enrolling patients . <S>
The delayed - phase thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 is prone to develop in elderly patients or patients with low lymphocyte count on admission . <S>
The delayed - phase thrombocytopenia is significantly associated with increased length of hospital stay and higher mortality rate . <S>
Delayed - phase nadir platelet counts demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with B cell percentages . <S>
We also presented bone marrow aspiration pathology of three patients with delayed - phase thrombocytopenia ,
showing impaired maturation of megakaryocytes . <S>
We speculated
that immune mediated platelet destruction might account for the delayed - phase thrombocytopenia in a group of patients . <S>
Besides , clinicians need to pay attention to the delayed - phase thrombocytopenia especially at 3 - 4 weeks after symptom onset . <S> <P>
