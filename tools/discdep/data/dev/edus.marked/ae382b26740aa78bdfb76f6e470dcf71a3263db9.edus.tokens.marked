Previous analysis of porcine respiratory coronavirus ( PRCV ) mRNA species showed
that mRNAs 2 and 3 were smaller than the corresponding transmissible gastroenteritis virus ( TGEV ) mRNA species ( Page et al . ( 1991 ) J. Gen. Virol . 72 , 579 - 587 ) . <S>
Sequence analysis showed
that mRNA 3 was smaller
due to the presence of a new putative RNA - leader binding site upstream of the PRCV ORF-3 gene . <S>
However , this observation did not explain the deletion
observed in PRCV mRNA 2 . <S>
Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) was used
to generate cDNA from the 3 ' coding region of the putative polymerase gene to the poly ( A ) tail of PRCV for comparison to the equivalent region from TGEV . <S>
The PRCV S protein was found to consist of 1225 amino acids ,
which had 98 % similarity to the TGEV S protein . <S>
However , the PRCV S gene contained a 672 nucleotide deletion ,
corresponding to 224 amino acids
( residues 21 to 245 in TGEV S protein ) ,
59 nucleotides downstream of the S gene initiation codon . <S>
The PRCV genome from the ORF-3 gene to the poly ( A ) tail was sequenced for comparison to TGEV
in order to identify other potential differences between the two viruses . <S>
Four ORFs were identified
that showed 98 % similarity to the TGEV ORF-4 , M , N and ORF-7 genes . <S>
No other deletions or any PRCV specific sequences were identified . <S> <P>
