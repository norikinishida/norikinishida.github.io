By equipping a previously reported dynamic causal model of COVID-19 with an isolation state ,
we modelled the effects of self - isolation consequent on tracking and tracing . <S>
Specifically , we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people
who believe
they might be infected
but are asymptomatic
- and only leave
if they test negative . <S>
We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters
using time series of new cases , daily deaths , and tests for the UK . <S>
These parameters were used
to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18month period . <S>
Several clear - cut conclusions emerged from these simulations . <S>
For example , under plausible ( graded ) relaxations of social distancing , a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely . <S>
The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate
at which we lose immunity ,
inherited from the first wave . <S>
There exists no testing strategy
that can attenuate mortality rates ,
other than by deferring or delaying a second wave . <S>
A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy
- implemented at the time of writing ( 10th May 2020) -
will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months . <S>
Crucially , this deferment is within current testing capabilities
( requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20 % of asymptomatic infected cases , with less than 50,000 tests per day ) . <S>
These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model
for which we provide some construct and face validation
using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany ,
supplemented with recent serological studies . <S> <P>
