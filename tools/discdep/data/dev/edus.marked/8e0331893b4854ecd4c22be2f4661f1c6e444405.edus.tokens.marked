Multilayer networks proved to be suitable in extracting and providing dependency information of different complex systems . <S>
The construction of these networks is difficult
and is mostly done with a static approach ,
neglecting time delayed interdependences . <S>
Tensors are objects
that naturally represent multilayer networks
and in this paper , we propose a new methodology
based on Tucker tensor autoregression
in order to build a multilayer network directly from data . <S>
This methodology captures within and between connections across layers
and makes use of a filtering procedure
to extract relevant information
and improve visualization . <S>
We show the application of this methodology to different stationary fractionally differenced financial data . <S>
We argue
that our result is useful
to understand the dependencies across three different aspects of financial risk , namely market risk , liquidity risk , and volatility risk . <S>
Indeed , we show
how the resulting visualization is a useful tool for risk managers
depicting dependency asymmetries between different risk factors
and accounting for delayed cross dependencies . <S>
The constructed multilayer network shows a strong interconnection between the volumes and prices layers across all the stocks
considered
while a lower number of interconnections between the uncertainty measures is identified . <S> <P>
