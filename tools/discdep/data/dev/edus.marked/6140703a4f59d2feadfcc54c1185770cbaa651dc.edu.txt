As SARS - COV-2 and the disease COVID-19 is sweeping through countries after countries around the globe ,
it is critical to understand potential burden of a future outbreak in cities of Colombia . <S>
This pandemic has affected most of the countries in the world
because the high global movement of individuals and excessive cost in interventions . <S>
Objective : <S>
Using demographic data from city of Cali , disease epidemiological information from affected countries and mathematical models ,
we estimated the rate of initial exponential growth of new cases and the basic reproductive rate for a potential outbreak in city of Cali in Colombia . <S>
Materials and methods : <S>
We used dynamical models with different modeling assumptions
such as use of various types of interventions and/or epidemiological characteristics
to compare and contrast the differences between Colombian cities and between Latin American countries . <S>
Results : <S>
Under the assumption of homogeneously mixing population and limited resources ,
we predicted expected number of infected , hospitalized , in Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) and deaths during this potential COVID-19 outbreak . <S>
Our results suggest
that on a given day in Cali there may be up to around 73000 cases
who might need hospitalization under no intervention . <S>
However , this number drastically reduces
if we carry out only - isolation intervention
( with 16 days of symptomatic infection ; ~13,000 cases )
versus both quarantining for 6 days and isolation within 16 days
( ~3500 cases ) . <S>
The peak in Cali will reach in 2 - 3 months . <S>
Conclusions . <S>
The estimates from these studies provides different scenarios of outbreaks
and can help Cali to be better prepared during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak . <S> <P>
