Topic modeling is frequently employed
for discovering structures ( or patterns ) in a corpus of documents . <S>
Its utility in text - mining and document retrieval tasks in various fields of scientific research is rather well known . <S>
An unsupervised machine learning approach , Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) has particularly been utilized
for identifying latent ( or hidden ) topics in document collections
and for deciphering the words
that define one or more topics
using a generative statistical model . <S>
Here we describe
how SARS - CoV-2 genomic mutation profiles can be structured into a ' Bag of Words '
to enable identification of signatures ( topics ) and their probabilistic distribution across various genomes
using LDA . <S>
Topic models were generated
using ~47000 novel corona virus genomes
( considered as documents ) ,
leading to identification of 16 amino acid mutation signatures and 18 nucleotide mutation signatures
( equivalent to topics )
in the corpus of chosen genomes through coherence optimization . <S>
The document assumption for genomes also helped in identification of contextual nucleotide mutation signatures in the form of conventional Ngrams
( e.g. bi - grams and tri - grams ) . <S>
We validated the signatures
obtained
using LDA driven method
against the previously reported recurrent mutations and phylogenetic clades for genomes . <S> <P>
Additionally , we report the geographical distribution of the identified mutation signatures in SARS - CoV-2 genomes on the global map . <S>
Use of the non - phylogenetic albeit classical approaches like topic modeling and other data centric pattern mining algorithms is therefore proposed for supplementing the efforts
towards understanding the genomic diversity of the evolving SARS - CoV-2 genomes ( and other pathogens / microbes ) . <S> <P>
