Ebola virus ( EBOV ) , a non - segmented single - stranded RNA virus , is often - most transmitted through body fluids like sweat , tears , saliva , and nasal secretions . <S>
Till date , there is no licensed vaccine of EBOV is available in the market ; <S>
however , the world is increasingly vulnerable to this emerging threat . <S>
Hence , it is the need of time to develop a vaccine for EBOV
to hinder its dissemination . <S>
The current study has been designed for identification and characterization of the potential B and T - cell epitopes
using the Immuno - informatics tools ,
and it helped in finding the potent vaccine candidates against EBOV . <S>
Prediction , antigenicity and allergenicity testing of predicted B and T cells ' epitopes was done
as well to identify their potential as a vaccine candidate
and to measure their safety level respectively . <S>
Among B - cell epitopes " WIPAGIGVTGVIIA " showed a high antigenicity score
and it would play an important role
in evoking the immune response . <S>
In T - cell epitopes , peptides " AIGLAWIPY " and " IRGFPRCRY " presented high antigenicity score ,
which binds to MHC class - I and MHC class - II alleles respectively . <S>
All predicted epitopes were analyzed
and compared with already reported peptides carefully . <S>
Comparatively , Peptides
predicted in the present study
showed more immunogenicity score than already reported peptides ,
used as positive control ,
and are more immunogenic
as compared to them . <S> <P>
