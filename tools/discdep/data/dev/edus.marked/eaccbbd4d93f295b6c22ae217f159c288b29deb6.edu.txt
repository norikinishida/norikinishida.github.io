Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( PRRS ) has been one of the most economically important diseases
affecting swine industry worldwide
and causes great economic losses each year . <S>
PRRS virus ( PRRSV ) replicates mainly in porcine alveolar macrophages ( PAMs ) and dendritic cells ( DCs )
and develops persistent infections , antibody - dependent enhancement ( ADE ) , interstitial pneumonia and immunosuppression . <S>
But the molecular mechanisms of PRRSV infection still are poorly understood . <S>
Here we report on the first genome - wide host transcriptional responses to classical North American type PRRSV ( N - PRRSV ) strain CH 1a infection
using Solexa / Illumina 's digital gene expression ( DGE ) system , a tagbased high - throughput transcriptome sequencing method ,
and analyse systematically the relationship between pulmonary gene expression profiles after N - PRRSV infection and infection pathology . <S>
Our results suggest
that N - PRRSV appeared to utilize multiple strategies for its replication and spread in infected pigs ,
including subverting host innate immune response ,
inducing an anti - apoptotic and anti - inflammatory state
as well as developing ADE . <S>
Upregulation expression of virus - induced pro - inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , adhesion molecules and inflammatory enzymes and inflammatory cells , antibodies , complement activation were likely to result in the development of inflammatory responses during N - PRRSV infection processes . <S>
N - PRRSV - induced immunosuppression might be mediated by apoptosis of infected cells ,
which caused depletion of immune cells
and induced an anti - inflammatory cytokine response
in which they were unable to eradicate the primary infection . <S>
Our systems analysis will benefit for better understanding the molecular pathogenesis of N - PRRSV infection , developing novel antiviral therapies and identifying genetic components for swine resistance / susceptibility to PRRS . <S> <P>
