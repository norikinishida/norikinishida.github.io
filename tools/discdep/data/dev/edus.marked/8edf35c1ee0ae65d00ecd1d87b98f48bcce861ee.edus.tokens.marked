Mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and hypertension . <S>
These disorders share underlying pathophysiology
related to the renin - angiotensin system ( RAS )
that may be clinically insightful . <S>
In particular , activity of the angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease ,
and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV-2 )
to initiate the infection . <S>
Cardiovascular disease and pharmacologic RAS inhibition both increase ACE2 levels ,
which may increase the virulence of SARS - CoV-2 within the lung and heart . <S>
Conversely , mechanistic evidence from related coronaviruses suggests
that SARS - CoV-2 infection may downregulate ACE2 ,
leading to toxic overaccumulation of Angiotensin II
that induces acute respiratory distress syndrome and fulminant myocarditis . <S>
RAS inhibition could mitigate this effect . <S>
With conflicting mechanistic evidence , we propose key clinical research priorities necessary
to clarify the role of RAS inhibition in COVID-19 mortality
that could be rapidly addressed by the international research community . <S> <P>
