Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( PRRSV ) is an economically important swine pathogen . <S>
Since its discovery in the early 1990s , tremendous progresses have been made in understanding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of PRRSV . <S>
Although modified live - attenuated vaccines ( MLVs ) and inactivated vaccines against PRRSV have been available for more than a decade ,
the disease remains difficult to control . <S>
The efficacies of these vaccines especially against heterologous strains remain questionable : <S>
the MLVs were generally effective against homologous strains but variable in success against heterologous strains ,
and the outcomes of inactivated vaccines in the field are not very promising . <S>
With the development of PRRSV reverse genetics systems and the acquisition of new understanding on anti - PRRSV immunity , rational design of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines can now be explored . <S>
In this review , we discussed the recent advances in anti - PRRSV immunity and vaccinology , the recent progresses in PRRSV vaccine development particularly the reverse genetics system - based vaccine development ,
and provided a perspective on potential novel strategies and approaches
that may be applicable to the development of the next generation of PRRSV vaccines . <S> <P>
