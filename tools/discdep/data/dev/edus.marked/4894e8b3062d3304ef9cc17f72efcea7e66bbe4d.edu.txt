Chemical denaturant sensitivity of the dimeric main protease from severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) coronavirus to guanidinium chloride was examined in terms of fluorescence spectroscopy , circular dichroism , analytical ultracentrifuge , and enzyme activity change . <S>
The dimeric enzyme dissociated at guanidinium chloride concentration of , 0.4 M ,
at which the enzymatic activity loss showed close correlation with the subunit dissociation . <S>
Further increase in guanidinium chloride induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme . <S>
The unfolding of the C - terminal domain - truncated enzyme , on the other hand , followed a monophasic unfolding curve . <S>
Different mutants of the full - length protease
( W31 and W207 / W218 ) ,
with tryptophanyl residue(s )
mutated to phenylalanine at the C - terminal or N - terminal domain , respectively ,
were constructed . <S>
Unfolding curves of these mutants were monophasic
but corresponded to the first and second phases of the protease , respectively . <S>
The unfolding intermediate of the protease thus represented a folded C - terminal domain but an unfolded N - terminal domain ,
which is enzymatically inactive
due to loss of regulatory properties . <S>
The various enzyme forms were characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size - and - shape distributions . <S>
We provide direct evidence for the functional role of C - terminal domain in stabilization of the catalytic N - terminal domain of SARS coronavirus main protease . <S> <P>
