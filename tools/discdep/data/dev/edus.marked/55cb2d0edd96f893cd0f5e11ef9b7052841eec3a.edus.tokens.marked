Tuberculosis is the deadliest infection of our time . <S>
In contrast , about 11,000 people died of Ebola between 2014 and 2016 . <S>
Despite this manifest difference in mortality ,
there is now a vaccine
licensed in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency ,
with up to 100 % efficacy against Ebola . <S>
The developments
that led to the trialing of the Ebola vaccine
were historic and unprecedented . <S>
The single licensed TB vaccine ( BCG ) has limited efficacy . <S>
There is a dire need for a more efficacious TB vaccine . <S>
To deploy such vaccines ,
trials are needed in sites
that combine high disease incidence and research infrastructure . <S>
We describe our twelve - year experience
building a TB vaccine trial site
in contrast to the process in the recent Ebola outbreak . <S>
There are additional differences . <S>
Relative to the Ebola pipeline ,
TB vaccines have fewer trials and a paucity of government and industry led trials . <S>
While pathogens have varying levels of difficulty in the development of new vaccine candidates ,
there yet appears to be greater interest in funding and coordinating Ebola interventions . <S>
TB is a global threat
that requires similar concerted effort for elimination . <S> <P>
