It is normal for hosts to be co - infected by parasites . <S>
Interactions among co - infecting species can have profound consequences ,
including changing parasite transmission dynamics , altering disease severity and confounding attempts at parasite control . <S>
Despite the importance of co - infection ,
there is currently no way
to predict how different parasite species may interact with one another , nor the consequences of those interactions . <S>
Here , we demonstrate a method
that enables such prediction
by identifying two nematode parasite groups
based on taxonomy and characteristics of the parasitological niche . <S>
From an understanding of the interactions between the two defined groups in one host system ( wild rabbits ) , we predict how two different nematode species , from the same defined groups , will interact in co - infections in a different host system ( sheep ) ,
and then we test this experimentally . <S>
We show
that , as predicted , in co - infections , the blood - feeding nematode Haemonchus contortus suppresses aspects of the sheep immune response ,
thereby facilitating the establishment and/or survival of the nematode Trichostrongylus colubriformis ;
and that the T. colubriformis - induced immune response negatively affects H. contortus . <S>
This work is , to our knowledge , the first
to use empirical data from one host system
to successfully predict the specific outcome of a different co - infection in a second host species . <S>
The study therefore takes the first step
in defining a practical framework
for predicting interspecific parasite interactions in other animal systems . <S> <P>
