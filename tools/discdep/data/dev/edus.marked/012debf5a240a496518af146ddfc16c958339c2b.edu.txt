Background : <S>
EU Decision 1082/2013 / EU on serious cross - border health threats provides a legal basis for collaboration between EU Member States , and between international and European level institutions on preparedness , prevention , and mitigation in the event of a public health emergency . <S>
The Decision provides a context for the present study ,
which aims to identify good practices and lessons
learned in preparedness and response to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) ( in UK , Greece , and Spain ) and poliomyelitis ( in Poland and Cyprus ) . <S>
Methods : <S>
Based on a documentary review ,
followed by five week - long country visits
involving a total of 61 interviews and group discussions with experts from both the health and non - health sectors ,
this qualitative case study has investigated six issues
related to preparedness and response to MERS and poliomyelitis :
national plans and overall preparedness capacity ; training and exercises ; risk communication ; linking policy and implementation ; interoperability between the health and non - health sectors ; and cross - border collaboration . <S> <P>
Results : <S>
Preparedness and response plans for MERS and poliomyelitis were in place in the participating countries ,
with a high level of technical expertise available to implement them . <S>
Nevertheless , formal evaluation of the responses to previous public health emergencies have sometimes been limited ,
so lessons learned may not be reflected in updated plans ,
thereby risking mistakes
being repeated in future . <S>
The nature and extent of intersectoral collaboration varied according to the sectors involved , with those sectors
that have traditionally had good collaboration
( e.g. animal health and food safety ) ,
as well as those
that have a financial incentive for controlling infectious diseases
( e.g. agriculture , tourism , and air travel )
seen as most likely to have integrated public health preparedness and response plans . <S>
Although the formal protocols for inter - sectoral collaboration were not always up to date ,
good personal relations were reported within the relevant professional networks ,
which could be brought into play in the event of a public health emergency . <S>
Cross - border collaboration was greatly facilitated
if the neighbouring country was a fellow EU Member State . <S> <P>
