The hologram is an ideal method
for displaying three - dimensional images visible to the naked eye . <S>
Metasurfaces
consisting of subwavelength structures
show great potential in light field manipulation ,
which is useful for overcoming the drawbacks of common computer - generated holography . <S>
However , there are long - existing challenges to achieving dynamic meta - holography in the visible range ,
such as low frame rate and low frame number . <S>
In this work , we demonstrate a design of meta - holography
that can achieve 2 28 different holographic frames and an extremely high frame rate
( 9523 frames per second )
in the visible range . <S>
The design is based on a space channel metasurface and a high - speed dynamic structured laser beam modulation module . <S>
The space channel consists of silicon nitride nanopillars with a high modulation efficiency . <S>
This method can satisfy the needs of a holographic display
and be useful in other applications ,
such as laser fabrication , optical storage , optics communications , and information processing . <S>
