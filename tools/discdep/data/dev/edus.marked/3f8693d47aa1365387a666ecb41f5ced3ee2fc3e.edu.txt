Use of pecan shell fiber in human food is presently limited ,
but could increase pending demonstration of safety . <S>
In a 91-day rat study , pecan shell fiber was administered at dietary concentrations of 0 ( control ) , 50 000 , 100 000 or 150 000 ppm . <S>
There was no effect of the ingredient on body weight of males or females or food consumption of females . <S>
Statistically significant increases in food consumption were observed throughout the study in 100 000 and 150 000 ppm males ,
resulting in intermittent decreases in food efficiency
( 150 000 ppm males only )
that were not biologically relevant . <S>
All animals survived
and no adverse clinical signs or functional changes were attributable to the test material . <S>
There were no toxicologically relevant changes in hematology , clinical chemistry or urinalysis parameters or organ weights in rats
ingesting pecan shell fiber . <S>
Any macroscopic or microscopic findings were incidental , of normal variation and/or of minimal magnitude for test substance association . <S>
Pecan shell fiber was non - mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation test and non - clastogenic in a mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test . <S>
Based on these results ,
pecan shell fiber has an oral subchronic
( 13-week )
no observable adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) of 150 000 ppm in rats
and is not genotoxic at the doses analyzed . <S> <P>
