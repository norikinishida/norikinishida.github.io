COVID-19 has massively changed the health landscape around the world . <S>
Wide - ranging changes to healthcare delivery have occurred , especially in hospitals and EDs . <S>
Health services have made local decisions about care pathways , in some cases
deviating from what would , until recently , have been considered widely accepted care . <S>
These changes bring with them new medicolegal risk for clinicians . <S>
In Australia , civil liability Acts provide protection for professionals
when the criterion
of having undertaken ' competent ' practice
that would be ' widely accepted ' ' in the circumstances '
is met . <S>
There is doubt
how courts , and the medical experts
who advise them ,
will evaluate clinical care
provided during the pandemic
when health services have developed local care pathways
and there is no nationally accepted standard . <S> <P>
