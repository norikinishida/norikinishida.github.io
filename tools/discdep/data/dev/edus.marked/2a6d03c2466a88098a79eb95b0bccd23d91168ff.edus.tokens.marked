Antimicrobial stewardship program aims to reduce antibiotic use . <S>
Periodic measurement and monitoring of antibiotic use and comparison within the institution as well as with other organizations are important indicators . <S>
We analyzed antibiotic usage in a general hospital in Saudi Arabia . <S>
Antibiotic data were collected retrospectively for 2011 and from 2013 to 2015 ,
and only adult patients
( > 15 year of age )
were included in the study . <S>
Data were presented as days of therapy ( DOT )
and defined daily dose ( DDD ) . <S>
DDD was adjusted per 100 bed - days and according to the case mix index ( CMI ) . <S>
The total DDD was 37,557 in 2013 , 36,550 in 2014 and 38,738 in 2015 . <S>
The DDD per 100 patient - days was 90.7 - 94.5 . <S>
There was a discordant findings of antibiotic measurements
based on the DDD
compared to DOT ,
and DDD/100 beddays
compared to DOT/100 bed - days . <S>
There was a negative correlation between CMI and DDD per 100 bed days
( r âˆ’0.696 ) ,
but a positive correlation of CMI with DOT
( r +0.93 ) . <S>
Adjusted DDD/100 bed - days showed decrease in the usage of antibiotics ,
reflecting activities of the antibiotic stewardship program . <S>
The increase in DOT/100 bed - days may indicate the favorable utilization of combination therapy . <S>
Antibiotic usage needs to be adjusted per 100 bed - days and correlated with CMI for better reflection of optimal antibiotic utilization , activities of the antibiotic stewardship program , and to allow benchmarking . <S> <P>
