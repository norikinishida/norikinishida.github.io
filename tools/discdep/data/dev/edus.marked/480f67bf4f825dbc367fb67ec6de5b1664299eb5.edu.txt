that requires specific control measures . <S>
Due to environmental factors , changes in lifestyle and many other unknown factors ,
the emergence of such HIDs is becoming more and more likely . <S>
As has already been demonstrated during the SARS outbreak ,

Preparedness planning will be essential
in helping facilities manage future outbreaks of emerging or resurgent infectious diseases . <S>
Guidelines have been developed by national and international institutions . <S>

the care of HID patients should follow the same infection control rules
