RNA viruses show enormous capacity
to evolve
and adapt to new cellular and molecular contexts ,
a consequence of mutations
arising from errors
made by viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase during replication . <S>
Sequence variation must occur , however ,
without compromising functions
essential for the completion of the viral cycle . <S>
RNA viruses are safeguarded in this respect by their genome
carrying conserved information
that does not code only for proteins
but also for the formation of structurally conserved RNA domains
that directly perform these critical functions . <S>
Functional RNA domains can interact with other regions of the viral genome and/or proteins
to direct viral translation , replication and encapsidation . <S>
They are therefore potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies . <S>
This review summarises our knowledge of the functional RNA domains of human RNA viruses
and examines the achievements
made in the design of antiviral compounds
that interfere with their folding and therefore their function . <S> <P>
