The treatment of surgical patients
who are confirmed or suspected of coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 )
is a challenge for all anesthesiologists . <S>
The safety of both patients and healthcare workers should be taken into consideration
when performing anesthesia management for patients with COVID-19 . <S>
General anesthesia
requiring airway intervention
may exacerbate COVID-19 pneumonia ,
and aerosol generation during airway intervention risks COVID-19 transmission to medical staff . <S>
However , regional anesthesia is not an aerosol - generating procedure . <S>
The neuraxial anesthesia may have little adverse influence on clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19
after reviewing previous case reports . <S>
Regional anesthesia may have some advantages over general anesthesia for this group of patients ,
but unplanned conversion to general anesthesia during surgery is not preferred . <S>
Thus , careful consideration should be given
to ensure
that the surgery is performed entirely under regional anesthesia . <S>
The use of ultrasound guidance and the performance by an experienced physician may reduce the incidence of failed block and complications . <S>
The use of long - acting local anesthetic prolongs the anesthetic effect of regional anesthesia . <S>
Besides , a safe and sufficient dose of local anesthetic should be used . <S> <P>
