Pandemics have a profound impact on our world ,
causing loss of life ,
affecting our culture
and historically shaping our genetics . <S>
The response to a pandemic requires both resilience and imagination . <S>
It has been clearly documented
that obtaining an accurate estimate and trends of the actual infection rate and mortality risk are very important for policy makers and medical professionals . <S>
One can not estimate mortality rates
without an accurate assessment of the number of infected individuals in the population . <S>
This need is also aligned with identifying the infected individuals
so they can be properly treated ,
monitored
and tracked . <S>
However , accurate estimation of the infection rate , locally , geographically and nationally is important independently . <S>
These infection rate estimates can guide policy makers at both state , national or world level to achieve a better management of risk to society . <S>
The decisions
facing policy makers
are very different during early stages of an emerging epidemic
where the infection rate is low ,
middle stages
where the rate is rapidly climbing ,
and later stages
where the epidemic curve has flattened to a low and relatively sustainable rate . <S>
In this paper we provide relatively efficient pooling methods
to both estimate infection rates
and identify infected individuals for populations with low infection rates . <S>
These estimates may provide significant cost reductions
for testing in rural communities , third world countries and other situations
where the cost of testing is expensive
or testing is not widely available . <S>
As we prepare for the second wave of the pandemic
this line of work may provide new solutions for both the biomedical community and policy makers at all levels . <S> <P>
