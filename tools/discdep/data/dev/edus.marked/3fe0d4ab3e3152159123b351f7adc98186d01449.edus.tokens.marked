Coronavirus disease 2019 , i.e. COVID-19 has imposed the public health measure
of keeping social distancing
for preventing mass transmission of COVID-19 . <S>
For monitoring the social distancing
and keeping the trace of transmission ,
we are obligated to develop various types of digital surveillance systems ,
which include contact tracing systems and drone - based monitoring systems . <S>
Due to the inconvenience of manual labor ,
traditional contact tracing systems are gradually replaced by the efficient automated contact tracing applications
that are developed for smartphones . <S>
However , the commencement of automated contact tracing applications introduces the inevitable privacy and security challenges . <S>
Nevertheless , unawareness and/or lack of smartphone usage among mass people lead to drone - based monitoring systems . <S>
These systems also invite unwelcomed privacy and security challenges . <S>
This paper discusses the recently designed and developed digital surveillance system applications with their protocols
deployed in several countries around the world . <S>
Their privacy and security challenges are discussed as well as analyzed from the viewpoint of privacy acts .
Several recommendations are suggested separately for automated contact tracing systems and drone - based monitoring systems , <S>
which could further be explored and implemented afterwards
to prevent any possible privacy violation
and protect an unsuspecting person from any potential cyber attack . <S> <P>
