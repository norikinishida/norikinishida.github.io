The coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic has posed a challenge for healthcare systems ,
and healthcare workers ( HCWs ) are at high risk of exposure . <S>
Protecting HCWs is of paramount importance
to maintain continuous patient care
and keep healthcare systems functioning . <S>
Used alongside administrative and engineering control measures ,
personal protective equipment ( PPE ) is the last line of defense and the core component of protection . <S>
Current data suggest
that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV-2 ) is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact . <S>
Airborne transmission may occur during aerosol - generating procedures . <S>
However , the modes of transmission still remain uncertain ,
especially regarding the possibility of airborne transmission
when aerosolgenerating procedures are not performed . <S>
Thus , there are some inconsistencies in the respiratory protective equipment
recommended by international and national organizations . <S>
In Korea , there have been several modifications to PPE recommendations
offering options
in choosing PPE for respiratory and body protection ,
which confuses HCWs ; <S>
they are often unsure what to wear and when to wear it . <S>
The choice of PPE is based on the risk of exposure and possible modes of transmission . <S>
The level of protection
provided by PPE
differs
based on standards and test methods . <S>
Thus , understanding them is the key
in selecting the proper PPE . <S>
This article reviews evidence on the mode of SARS - CoV-2 transmission ,
compares the current PPE recommendations of the World Health Organization with those in Korea ,
and discusses standard requirements and the proper selection of PPE . <S> <P>
