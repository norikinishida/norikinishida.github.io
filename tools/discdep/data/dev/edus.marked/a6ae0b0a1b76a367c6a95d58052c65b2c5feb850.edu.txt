Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system ( CNS )
that affects about 0.1 % of the worldwide population . <S>
This deleterious disease is marked by infiltration of myelinspecific T cells
that attack the protective myelin sheath
that surrounds CNS nerve axons . <S>
Upon demyelination , saltatory nerve conduction is disrupted ,
and patients experience neurologic deficiencies . <S>
The exact cause for MS remains unknown ,
although most evidence supports the hypothesis
that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease development . <S>
Epidemiologic evidence supports a role for environmental pathogens ,
such as viruses ,
as potentially key contributors to MS induction . <S>
Pathogens can induce autoimmunity via several well - studied mechanisms with the most postulated being molecular mimicry . <S>
Molecular mimicry occurs
when T cells specific for peptide epitopes derived from pathogens cross - react with selfepitopes ,
leading to autoimmune tissue destruction . <S>
In this review , we discuss an in vivo virusinduced mouse model of MS
developed in our laboratory ,
which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the mechanisms
underlying molecular mimicry - induced CNS autoimmunity . <S> <P>
