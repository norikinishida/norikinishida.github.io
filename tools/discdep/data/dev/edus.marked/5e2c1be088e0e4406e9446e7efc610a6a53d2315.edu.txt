Feline calicivirus ( FCV ) is a small non - enveloped virus
containing a single - stranded , positive - sense RNA genome of approximately 7.7 kb . <S>
FCV is a highly infectious pathogen of cats
and typically causes moderate , self - limiting acute oral and upper respiratory tract diseases or chronic oral diseases . <S>
In addition , in recent years , virulent , systemic FCV ( vs - FCV ) strains
causing severe systemic diseases with a high mortality rate of up to 67 %
have been reported in cats . <S>
Although FCV vaccines are commercially available ,
their efficacy is limited
due to antigenic diversity of FCV strains and short duration of immunity . <S>
In this study , we identified fexaramine as a potent inhibitor of FCV
including vs - FCV strains in cell culture
and demonstrated
that fexaramine is a entry blocker for FCV
by using various experiments
including time - of - addition studies , generation of resistant viruses in cell culture and the reverse genetics system . <S>
A fexaramine resistant FCV mutant has a single amino acid change in the P2 domain of VP1 ( the major capsid ) ,
and the importance of this mutation for conferring resistance was confirmed
using the reverse genetics system . <S>
A comparative analysis of viral resistance was also performed
using a peptidyl inhibitor ( NPI52 )
targeting FCV 3C - like protease . <S>
Finally , the effects of combination treatment of fexaramine and NPI52 against FCV replication and emergence of resistant viruses were investigated in cell culture . <S> <P>
