Recently developed vaccines provide a new way
of controlling rotavirus in sub - Saharan Africa . <S>
Models for the transmission dynamics of rotavirus are critical
both for estimating current burden from imperfect surveillance
and for assessing potential effects of vaccine intervention strategies . <S>
We examine rotavirus infection in the Maradi area in southern Niger
using hospital surveillance data
provided by Epicentre
collected over two years . <S>
Additionally , a cluster survey of households in the region allows us to estimate the proportion of children with diarrhea
who consulted at a health structure . <S>
Model fit and future projections are necessarily particular to a given model ; <S>
thus , where there are competing models for the underlying epidemiology
an ensemble approach can account for that uncertainty . <S>
We compare our results across several variants of Susceptible - Infectious - Recovered ( SIR ) compartmental models
to quantify the impact of modeling assumptions on our estimates . <S>
Model - specific parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference
using Markov chain Monte Carlo . <S>
We then use Bayesian model averaging
to generate ensemble estimates of the current dynamics ,
including estimates of R 0 , the burden of infection in the region , as well as the impact of vaccination on both the short - term dynamics and the long - term reduction of rotavirus incidence under varying levels of coverage . <S>
The ensemble of models predicts
that the current burden of severe rotavirus disease is 2.6 - 3.7 % of the population each year
and that a 2-dose vaccine schedule achieving 70 % coverage could reduce burden by 39 - 42 % . <S> <P>
