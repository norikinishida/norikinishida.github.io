Avian infectious bronchitis ( IB ) is a major cause of economic losses in poultry industry . <S>
The IB virus primarily affects respiratory tract ,
but various strains differ in their tropism for other target organs
such as kidney and alimentary tract . <S>
The objective of this study was to estimate the pathogenicity of Iranian IBV variant ( IR-1 ) ,
which is limited exclusively to Iran . <S>
Specific pathogen free chicks were inoculated intranasally . <S>
Sera , fecal swabs and different tissue samples were collected on different days post infection ( DPI ) . <S>
Clinical signs , gross pathology and histological changes were recorded . <S>
The viral load was quantified in the RNA extractions from different tissue samples
using real - time PCR . <S>
Anti - IBV antibodies were detected in serum samples . <S>
The IgG antibody were found on 21 and 28 DPI . <S>
Severe histological lesions were observed in the trachea and lung
while the lesions in kidney were appeared to be milder . <S>
Viral RNA was detected in all tested tissues from 1 DPI to the last day of the experiment . <S>
The highest viral load was measured in the trachea and feces on 1 st and 5 th DPI , respectively . <S>
It can be concluded
the IR-1 had broad tropism for respiratory tract , digestive system , and renal tissue ,
reflecting its epitheliotropic nature ,
but it caused the most severe lesions in the respiratory tract . <S>
This was the first pathogenicity study of Iranian IR-1 IBV . <S>
Further knowledge of IBV pathogenesis provides the groundwork
to inform more effective prevention practices . <S> <P>
