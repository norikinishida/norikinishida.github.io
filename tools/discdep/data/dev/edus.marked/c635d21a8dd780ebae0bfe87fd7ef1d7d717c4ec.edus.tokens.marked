To assess the economic impact of bovine coronavirus ( BCV ) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus ( BRSV ) infections ,
accurate estimates of their associated effects on animal performance are needed . <S>
This study aimed to quantify the variation in individual test - day milk yield and somatic cell count , risk of reproductive failure after first service of dairy cows , and risk of death of calves and heifers according to the BCV and BRSV status of the herd . <S>
Three types of status were defined for BCV and BRSV infections ,
based on 1 ) the dynamics over a 7-mo period of BCV - and BRSV - specific antibody levels in pooled milk of primiparous cows ;
2 ) the possible occurrence of presumably BCV - and BRSV - related clinical outbreaks ;
and 3 ) the combination of both pieces of information . <S>
A total of 36,184 test days , 2,716 cows with a first service , and 4,104 calves and heifers in 65 Swedish herds were included in the analyses . <S>
Animal performance associated with BCV and BRSV infections was quantified
using hierarchical mixed generalized and survival models , after adjustment for covariates
known to influence the performance under study . <S>
A significant reduction in milk yield was observed for cows in presumably BRSV recently infected herds , as well as in herds having a presumably BRSV - related clinical outbreak
( of 0.57 and 0.91 kg / d , respectively ) ,
compared with cows in presumably infection - free herds . <S>
There was also a significant increase in somatic cell count
( of 12,000 cells / mL )
for cows located in herds with a BRSV outbreak . <S>
The risk of failure after first service , as well as the risk of death in calf and heifer , was numerically higher in BRSV - infected herds ,
although this was not statistically significant . <S>
In contrast , BCV infection herd status ,
as defined in the present study ,
was not significantly associated with any production losses in animals from infected herds
compared with those in infection - free herds . <S> <P>
