It is increasingly evident
that China has attached more attention to discursive power in foreign policy since the early 21st century . <S>
Both top leaders and government agencies have been active
in advocating for a new discourse on various international occasions . <S>
Previously , China has been reluctant to join the debate in international affairs ,
and been instead preoccupied with domestic affairs since the late 1970s . <S>
The situation has changed since 2009
because of China 's rapid rise
to become the world 's second largest economy . <S>
With regard to the motivations behind the Chinese government 's support for discursive power ,
the dominant explanation is based on the ' ' rise of China ' ' argument . <S>
However , this argument does not explain the causal relationship between China 's rise and its discursive power strategy . <S>
So , this paper aims to clarify the motivation behind China 's discursive power strategy through document reviews and interviews with mainstream scholars . <S>
It concludes
that a discursive power strategy has been the fundamental principle of the Communist Party of China since its establishment in 1921 . <S>
Since China 's adoption of an opening - up policy in 1978 , this tradition has been suppressed
but not eliminated entirely by top leaders . <S>
As China continues to rise on the world stage ,
the principle will drive China to create a new political model
rather than be a mere follower of the established political order . <S> <P>
