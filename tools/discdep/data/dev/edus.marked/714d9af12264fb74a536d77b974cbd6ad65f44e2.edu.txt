Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 ( SARS - CoV-2 ) has recently caused a pandemic
that has involved Italy as the second worldwide nation in terms of infected patients and deaths . <S>
The clinical manifestation of Covid-19 ranges from asymptomatic carrier status to severe pneumonia . <S>
Asymptomatic individuals in Covid-19 are those
who are carriers of the virus
but do not show clinical symptoms
and are able to transmit the disease in the same degree as symptomatic carriers . <S>
In order to contain contagions
is of supreme importance to identify asymptomatic patients
because this subpopulation is one of the main factors
contributing to the spread of this disease . <S>
We report on six Italian patients with COVID-19
who presented sudden hyposmia as the only or most prominent disease manifestation , without upper or lower respiratory tract involvement or other major features of the disease . <S>
A supra - threshold olfaction test confirmed the hyposmia in all patients . <S> <P>
