Avian metapneumovirus ( aMPV ) is one of the major causes of serious respiratory infections of poultry
and leads to considerable economic losses to food animal production worldwide . <S>
Here , we show
that double stranded short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) molecules
corresponding to aMPV phosphoprotein ( P ) gene
silence P RNA and protein expression . <S>
These siRNAs broadly reduced the expression of other viral proteins in addition to P ,
but did not have a discernable effect on cellular protein expression . <S>
The exposure of cells to P - specific siRNAs also led to inhibition of virus replication
as evidenced by marked reduction in the progeny virion titers . <S>
Taken together ,
the findings suggest
that exogenous P silencing siRNAs can inhibit aMPV replication with potential implications in the design of novel siRNA based prophylactics . <S> <P>
