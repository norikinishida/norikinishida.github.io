The current health , political , and environmental crisis
ongoing in Brazil
and the advances of the impacts of COVID-19 in traditional populations ( as indigenous and quilombolas ) are not yet prioritized in the scientific production about the novel coronavirus . <S>
We performed spatial correlation analysis
to map the clusters and outliers of COVID-19 in South of Brazil
to identify indigenous and quilombolas communities
impacted right now in the pandemic . <S>
We show
that communities located nearby metropolitan areas and mid - sized cities are the most impacted by the COVID-19
and the advance of the transmission to inner states may intensify the ongoing historical process of elimination of indigenous and quilombolas people . <S>
We call for a global response to the indigenous and quilombolas situation in Brazil ,
pointing to the need of more analysis in the country ; <S> <P>
