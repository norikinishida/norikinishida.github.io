Digital contact tracing applications are being developed by governments across the world ,
to track and trace contacts . <S>
With little evidence , citizens are being forced and made to believe
that it is an important step in pandemic control . <S>
We discuss briefly
if contact tracing will be successful in the control of the Corona virus pandemic
or is it just a tool
governments are using
to cover their helplessness . <S> <P>
