In the present studies , we report the cloning and structural characterization of the HFGL2 gene and its functional role in human fulminant hepatitis . <S>
The HFGL2 gene is approximately 7 kb in length with 2 exons . <S>
The putative promoter contains cis element consensus sequences
that strongly suggest the inducibility of its expression . <S>
From the nucleotide sequence of the human gene , a 439-amino acid long protein is predicted . <S>
The overall identity between the murine fgl2 and hfgl2 coded proteins is over 70 % . <S>
About 225 amino acids at the carboxyl end of these molecules are almost 90 % identical ,
and correspond to a well - conserved fibrinogen - related domain . <S>
Both HFGL2 and FGL2 encode a type II transmembrane protein with a predicted catalytic domain toward the amino terminus of the protein . <S>
Transient transfection of Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells with a fulllength cDNA of HFGL2 coding region resulted in high levels of prothrombinase activity . <S>
Livers from 8 patients
transplanted for fulminant viral hepatitis
were examined for extent of necrosis , inflammation , fibrin deposition , and HFGL2 induction . <S>
In situ hybridization showed positive staining of macrophages in areas of active hepatocellular necrosis . <S>
Fibrin stained positively in these areas
and was confirmed by electron microscopy . <S>
These studies define a unique prothrombinase gene ( HFGL2 )
and implicate its importance in the pathogenesis of fulminant viral hepatitis . <S> <P>
