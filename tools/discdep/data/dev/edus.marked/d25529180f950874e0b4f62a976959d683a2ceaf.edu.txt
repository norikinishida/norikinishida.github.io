The N - terminal domain of the coronavirus nucleocapsid ( N ) protein adopts a fold
resembling a right hand with a flexible , positively charged b - hairpin and a hydrophobic palm . <S>
This domain was shown to interact with the genomic RNA for coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) . <S>
Based on its 3D structure ,
we used site - directed mutagenesis
to identify residues
essential for the RNA - binding activity of the IBV N protein and viral infectivity . <S>
Alanine substitution of either Arg-76 or Tyr-94 in the N - terminal domain of IBV N protein led to a significant decrease in its RNA - binding activity and a total loss of the infectivity of the viral RNA to Vero cells . <S>
In contrast , mutation of amino acid Gln-74 to an alanine ,
which does not affect the binding activity of the N - terminal domain ,
showed minimal , if any , detrimental effect on the infectivity of IBV . <S>
This study thus identifies residues
critical for RNA binding on the nucleocapsid surface ,
and presents biochemical and genetic evidence
that directly links the RNA binding capacity of the coronavirus N protein to the viral infectivity in cultured cells . <S>
This information would be useful in development of preventive and treatment approaches against coronavirus infection . <S> <P>
