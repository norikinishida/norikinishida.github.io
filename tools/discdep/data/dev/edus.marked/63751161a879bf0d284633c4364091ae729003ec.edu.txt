Globalization may be viewed as the growing interdependence of countries worldwide through the increasing volume and variety of cross - border transactions in goods and services , and also through the more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology . <S>
Globalization is not just an economic phenomenon ,
although it is frequently described as such ,
but includes commerce , disease and travel , and immigration ,
and as such it affects blood safety and supply in various ways . <S>
The relatively short travel times
offered by modern aviation
can result in the rapid spread of blood - borne pathogens
before measures
to counteract transmission
can be put in place ; <S>
this would have happened with SARS
if the basic life cycle of the SARS virus did not include an asymptomatic viraemia . <S>
This risk can be amplified by ecological factors
which effect the spread of these pathogens
once they are transferred to a na√Øve ecosystem ,
as happened with West Nile virus ( WNV ) in North America . <S>
The rationalization and contraction of the plasma products industry may be viewed as one aspect of globalization
imposed by the remorseless inevitability of the market ; <S>
the effect of this development on the safety and supply of products has yet to be seen ,
but the oversight and assurance of a shrinking number of players will present particular challenges . <S>
Similarly , the monopolization of technology , through patent enforcement
which puts access beyond the reach of developing countries ,
can have an effect on blood safety . <S>
The challenges
presented to blood safety by globalization
are heightening the tensions between the traditional focus on the product safety - zero - risk paradigm and the need
to view the delivery of safe blood as an integrated process . <S>
As an illustration of this tension , donor deferral measures
imposed by globalization - induced risks
such as vCJD and WNV
have resulted in the loss of the safest and most committed portion of the blood donor population in many Western countries ,
leading to an increased risk to safety and supply . <S>
It is only through an appreciation of the basic needs of transfusion medicine ,
including the enunciation of appropriate principles
to manage , rather than eliminate , risks ,
that the challenges imposed by globalization may be overcome . <S> <P>
