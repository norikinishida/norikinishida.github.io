The novel coronavirus ' high rate of asymptomatic transmission
combined with a lack of testing kits
call for a different approach
to monitor its spread and severity . <S>
We proposed the use of hospitalizations and hospital utilization data
to monitor the spread and severity . <S>
A proposed threshold of a declining 7-day moving average over a 14-day period , " 7&14 " was set
to communicate
when a wave of the novel coronavirus may have passed . <S>
The state of Ohio was chosen
to illustrate this threshold . <S>
While not the ideal solution for monitoring the spread of the epidemic ,
the proposed approach is an easy to implement framework
accounting for limitations of the data
inherent in the current epidemic . <S>
Hospital administrators and policy makers may benefit from incorporating this approach into their decision making . <S> <P>
