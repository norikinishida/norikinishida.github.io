Background : <S>
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ( PRRS ) viruses are a major cause of disease and economic loss in pigs worldwide . <S>
High genetic diversity among PRRSV strains is problematic for successful disease control by vaccination . <S>
Mosaic DNA and vaccinia ( VACV ) vaccines were developed
in order to improve protection against heterologous PRRSV strains . <S>
Methods : <S>
Piglets were primed and boosted with GP5-Mosaic DNA vaccine and recombinant GP5-Mosaic VACV ( rGP5-Mosaic VACV ) , respectively . <S>
Pigs
vaccinated with rGP5-WT ( VR2332 ) DNA and rGP5-WT VACV , or empty vector DNA and empty VACV respectively ,
served as controls . <S>
Virus challenge was given to separate groups of vaccinated pigs with VR2332 or MN184C. <S>
Necropsies were performed 14 days after challenge . <S>
Results : <S>
Vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic - based vaccines resulted in cellular reactivity and higher levels of neutralizing antibodies to both VR2332 and MN184C PRRSV strains . <S>
In contrast , vaccination of animals with the GP5-WT vaccines induced responses only to VR2332 . <S>
Furthermore , vaccination with the GP5-Mosaic based vaccines resulted in protection against challenge with two heterologous virus strains ,
as demonstrated by the significantly lower viral loads in serum , tissues , porcine alveolar macrophages ( PAMs ) , and bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluids , and less severe lung lesions after challenge with either MN184C or VR2332 ,
which have only 85 % identity . <S>
In contrast , significant protection by the GP5-WT based vaccines was only achieved against the VR2332 strain . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
GP5-Mosaic vaccines ,
using a DNA - prime / VACV boost regimen ,
conferred protection in pigs against heterologous viruses . <S> <P>
