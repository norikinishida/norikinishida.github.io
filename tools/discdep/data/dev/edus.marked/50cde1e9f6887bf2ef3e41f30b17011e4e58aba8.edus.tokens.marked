In order to survey the infectious situation of canine coronavirus ( CCV ) in giant panda population ,
a virus neutralization test
detecting specific antibodies against CCV in giant panda 's sera
was established
by using two - fold dilutions of serum and 100 TCIDso of the virus . <S>
The 62 sera samples of giant pandas ,
which were gathered from zoos and reserve region of Sichuan Province , China
were detected . <S>
The neutralization antibody titer of 1:4 was recognized as the positive criterion ,
8 sera samples were detected to be positive ,
and the positive rate was 12.9 % . <S>
The titers of neutralizing antibody ranged from 1:8 to 1:32 . <S>
It was the first comprehensive investigation on neutralization antibodies against CCV in giant panda population in China . <S>
The results of study showed
that the infection of CCV in giant panda population was universal ,
which has posed a threat to the health of giant panda . <S>
Therefore , it is incumbent on us to study safe and effective vaccines
to protect giant panda against CCV infection . <S> <P>
