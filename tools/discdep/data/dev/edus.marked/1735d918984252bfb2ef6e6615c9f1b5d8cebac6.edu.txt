Poly(A ) tails are functionally important features of all picornavirus RNA genomes . <S>
Some viruses have genomes with relatively short poly(A ) tails
( encephalomyocarditis virus )
whereas others have genomes with longer poly(A ) tails
( polioviruses and rhinoviruses ) . <S>
Here we review the polyadenylation of picornavirus RNA
as it relates to the structure and function of 3D pol . <S>
Poliovirus 3D pol uses template - dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms
as it replicates the poly(A ) tails of viral RNA ( Steil et al . , 2010 ) . <S>
These mechanisms are analogous to those
involved in the polyadenylation of vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus mRNAs . <S>
3D pol residues
intimately associated with viral RNA templates and products
regulate the size of poly(A ) tails in viral RNA ( Kempf et al . , 2013 ) . <S>
Consistent with their ancient evolutionary origins ,
picornavirus 3D pol and telomerase reverse transcriptase ( TERT ) share structural and functional features . <S>
Structurally , both 3D pol and TERT assume a " right - hand " conformation with thumb , palm and fingers domains
encircling templates and products . <S>
Functionally , both 3D pol and TERT use template - dependent reiterative transcription mechanisms
to synthesize repetitive sequences :
poly(A ) tails in the case of picornavirus RNA genomes and DNA telomeres in the case of eukaryotic chromosomes . <S>
Thus , picornaviruses and their eukaryotic hosts
( humans and animals )
maintain the 3 ends of their respective genomes via evolutionarily related mechanisms . <S> <P>
