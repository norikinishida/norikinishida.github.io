SARS - CoV-2 is a new RNA virus
affecting humans
and spreads extensively through world populations since its first outbreak in late December , 2019 . <S>
Whether the transmissibility and pathogenicity of SARS - CoV-2 is actively evolving , and driven by adaptation to the new host and environments is still unknown . <S>
Understanding the evolutionary mechanism
underlying epidemiological and pathological characteristics of COVID-19
is essential for predicting the epidemic trend ,
and providing guidance for disease control and treatments . <S>
Interrogating 22,078 SARS - CoV-2 genome sequences of 84 countries ,
we demonstrate with convincing evidence
that ( i ) SARS - CoV-2 genomes are overall conserved under purifying selection . <S>
( ii ) Ongoing positive selection is actively driving the evolution of specific genes . <S>
Notably , genes
related to coronavirus infection and host immune system defense
are under adaptive evolution
while genes
related to viral RNA replication , transcription and translation
are under purifying selection . <S>
A spatial and temporal landscape of 54 critical mutants is constructed
based on their divergence among viral haplotype clusters ,
of which multiple mutants potentially conferring viral transmissibility , infectivity and virulence of SARS - CoV-2 are highlighted . <S> <P>
