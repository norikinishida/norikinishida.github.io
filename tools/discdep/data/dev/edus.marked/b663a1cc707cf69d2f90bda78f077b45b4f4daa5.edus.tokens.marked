Monadic decomposability is a notion of variable independence ,
which asks
whether a given formula in a first - order theory is expressible as a Boolean combination of monadic predicates in the theory . <S>
Recently , Veanes et al . showed the usefulness of monadic decomposability in the context of SMT
( i.e. the input formula is quantifier - free ) ,
and found various interesting applications
including string analysis . <S>
However , checking monadic decomposability is undecidable in general . <S>
Decidability for certain theories is known
( e.g. Presburger Arithmetic , Tarski 's Real - Closed Field ) ,
but there are very few results
regarding their computational complexity . <S>
In this paper , we study monadic decomposability of integer linear arithmetic in the setting of SMT . <S>
We show that this decision problem is coNP - complete
and ,
when monadically decomposable ,
a formula admits a decomposition of exponential size in the worst case . <S>
We provide a new application of our results to string constraint solving with length constraints . <S>
We then extend our results to variadic decomposability ,
where predicates could admit multiple free variables
( in contrast to monadic decomposability ) . <S>
Finally , we give an application to quantifier elimination in integer linear arithmetic
where the variables in a block of quantifiers ,
if independent ,
could be eliminated with an exponential
( instead of the standard doubly exponential )
blow - up . <S> <P>
