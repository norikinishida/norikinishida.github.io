The current coronavirus disease pandemic
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
has led to immense strain on healthcare systems and workers . <S>
Patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with acute neurological emergencies such as ischemic stroke . <S>
Ischemic stroke in these patients may result from COVID-19 related complications or decompensation of previously asymptomatic cerebrovascular disorders , or concurrent ischemic stroke from common stroke risk factors in a patient with COVID-19 . <S>
Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions require emergent triage , intensive care , and mechanical thrombectomy . <S>
Management of patients with large vessel occlusions ( LVO ) requires special considerations in the current pandemic . <S>
Physicians must now account for prognosis of severe COVID-19 , resource utilization , and risk of infection to healthcare workers
when determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy ( MT ) . <S>
Here , we describe important prognostic factors
including age , laboratory , and imaging findings
to consider for MT selection
and provide suggestions
for taking care of patients with LVO and possible or confirmed COVID-19 . <S>
It is recommended to perform MT in patients within the established guidelines ,
and consider a conservative approach in cases
where there is clinical equipoise
to minimize futile reperfusion . <S>
Lastly , we describe an illustrative case of a patient with ischemic stroke and COVID-19 . <S> <P>
