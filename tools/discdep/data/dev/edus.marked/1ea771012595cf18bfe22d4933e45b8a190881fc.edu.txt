The novel Coronavirus has caused a global crisis
and many governments have taken social measures ,
such as home quarantine and maintaining social distance . <S>
Many recent studies show
that network structure and human mobility greatly influence the dynamics of epidemic spreading . <S>
In this paper , we utilize a discrete - time Markov chain approach
and propose an epidemic model
to describe virus propagation in the heterogeneous graph ,
which is used
to represent individuals with intra social connections and mobility between individuals and common locations . <S>
There are two types of nodes , individuals and public places ,
and disease can spread by social contacts among individuals and people
gathering in common areas . <S>
We give theoretical results about epidemic threshold and influence of isolation factor . <S>
Several numerical simulations are performed
and experimental results further demonstrate the correctness of proposed model . <S>
Non - monotonic relationship between mobility possibility and epidemic threshold and differences between Erdös - Rényi and power - law social connections are revealed . <S>
In summary , our proposed approach and findings are helpful to analyse and prevent the epidemic spreading in networked population with recurrent mobility pattern . <S> <P>
