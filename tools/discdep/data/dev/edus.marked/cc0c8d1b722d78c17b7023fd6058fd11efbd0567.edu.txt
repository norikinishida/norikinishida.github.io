OBJECTIVE : <S>
Recent experiences in the United States with unprecedented terrorist attacks ( 9/11 ) and a devastating natural disaster ( Hurricane Katrina ) have demonstrated
that the medical care of mass casualties during such disasters poses ethical problems
not normally experienced in civilian health care . <S>
It is important to 1 ) identify the unique ethical challenges
facing physicians
who feel an obligation
to care for victims of such disasters
and 2 ) develop a national consensus on ethical guidelines as a resource for ethical decision making in medical disaster relief . <S>
STUDY DESIGN : <S>
A survey of pertinent literature was performed
to assess experience and opinions on the condition of medical care in terrorist attacks and natural disasters , the ethical challenges of disaster medical care , and the professional responsibilities and responsiveness in disasters . <S>
CONCLUSIONS : <S>
It is necessary to develop a national consensus on the ethical guidelines for physicians
who care for patients , victims , and casualties of disasters ,
and to formulate a virtuebased , yet practical , ethical approach to medical care under such extreme conditions . <S>
An educational curriculum for medical students , residents , and practicing physicians is required
to best prepare all physicians
who might be called upon , in the future ,
to triage patients , allocate resources , and make difficult decisions about treatment priorities and comfort care . <S>
It is not appropriate to address these questions at the time of the disaster ,
but rather in advance , as part of the ethics education of the medical profession . <S>
Important issues for resolution include inpatient and casualty triage and prioritization , medical liability , altered standards of care , justice and equity , informed consent and patient autonomy , expanding scope of practice in disaster medicine , and the moral and ethical responsibilities of physicians to care for disaster victims . <S> <P>
