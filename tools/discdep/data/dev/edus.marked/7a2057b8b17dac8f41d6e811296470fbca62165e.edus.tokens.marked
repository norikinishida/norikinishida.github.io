Introduction : <S>
Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra - pulmonary manifestation of influenza
while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy . <S>
Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity
due to H 1 N 1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 . <S>
However , to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature
linking H 1 N 1 with myocarditis in pregnancy . <S>
Case presentation : <S>
We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women
( aged 29 and 30 ) ,
with no preexisting illness ,
presenting with respiratory manifestations of H 1 N 1 influenza virus infection in their third trimester . <S>
Both women developed evidence of myocarditis . <S>
One woman developed acute respiratory distress syndrome ,
almost reaching the point of requiring extra - corporeal membrane oxygenation ,
and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy ; <S>
the other recovered without any long - term consequence . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively
if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H 1 N 1 virus or as a result of pregnancy ( in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies ) ,
the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H 1 N 1 influenza virus in pregnant women . <S>
This highlights the need for health care providers to increase awareness amongst caregivers
to target this ' at risk ' group aggressively with vaccination and prompt treatment . <S> <P>
