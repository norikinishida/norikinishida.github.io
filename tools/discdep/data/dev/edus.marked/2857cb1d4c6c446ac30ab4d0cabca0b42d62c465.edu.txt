Background : <S>
Existing standard non - molecular diagnostic methods
such as viral culture and immunofluorescent ( DFA )
are time - consuming , labor intensive or limited sensitivity . <S>
Several multiplex molecular assays are costly . <S>
Therefore , there is a need for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens . <S>
Methods : <S>
A GeXP - based multiplex RT - PCR assay ( GeXP assay ) was developed
to detect simultaneously sixteen different respiratory virus types / subtypes . <S>
Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were used
to initiate the RT - PCR ,
and one pair of universal primers was used for the subsequent cycles of the RT - PCR . <S>
The specificity of the GeXP assay was examined with positive controls for each virus type / subtype . <S>
The sensitivity was evaluated
by performing the assay on serial ten - fold dilutions of in vitro - transcribed RNA of all RNA viruses and the plasmids
containing the Adv and HBoV target sequence . <S>
GeXP assay was further evaluated
using 126 clinical specimens
and compared with Luminex xTAG RVP Fast assay . <S>
Results : <S>
The GeXP assay achieved a sensitivity of 20 - 200 copies for a single virus and 1000 copies
when all of the 16 pre - mixed viral targets were present . <S>
Analyses of 126 clinical specimens
using the GeXP assay
demonstrated
that GeXP assay and the RVP Fast assay were in complete agreement for 109/126 ( 88.51 % ) of the specimens . <S>
GeXP assay was more sensitive than the RVP Fast assay for the detection of HRV and PIV3 , and slightly less sensitive for the detection of HMPV , Adv , RSVB and HBoV. <S>
The whole process of the GeXP assay for the detection of 12 samples was completed within 2.5 hours . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
In conclusion , the GeXP assay is a rapid , cost - effective , sensitive , specific and high throughput method for the detection of respiratory virus infections . <S> <P>
