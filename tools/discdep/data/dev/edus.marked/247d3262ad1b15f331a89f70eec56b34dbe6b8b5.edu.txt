Background . <S>
The negative binomial distribution is used commonly throughout biology as a model for overdispersed count data , with attention
focused on the negative binomial dispersion parameter , k. <S>
A substantial literature exists on the estimation of k ,
but most attention has focused on datasets
that are not highly overdispersed
( i.e. , those with k$1 ) ,
and the accuracy of confidence intervals
estimated for k
is typically not explored . <S>
Methodology . <S>
This article presents a simulation study
exploring the bias , precision , and confidence interval coverage of maximum - likelihood estimates of k from highly overdispersed distributions . <S>
In addition to exploring small - sample bias on negative binomial estimates , the study addresses estimation from datasets
influenced by two types of event under - counting ,
and from disease transmission data subject to selection bias for successful outbreaks . <S>
Conclusions . <S>
Results show
that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward by small sample size or under - reporting of zero - class events ,
but are not biased downward by any of the factors considered . <S>
Confidence intervals
estimated from the asymptotic sampling variance
tend to exhibit coverage below the nominal level , with overestimates of k
comprising the great majority of coverage errors . <S>
Estimation from outbreak datasets does not increase the bias of k estimates ,
but can add significant upward bias to estimates of the mean . <S>
Because k varies inversely with the degree of overdispersion ,
these findings show
that overestimation of the degree of overdispersion is very rare for these datasets . <S> <P>
