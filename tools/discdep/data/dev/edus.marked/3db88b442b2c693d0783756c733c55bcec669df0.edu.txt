In this paper are presented mathematical predictions on the evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy of the COVID-19 pandemic
based on official data and on the use of a function of the type of a Gauss error function , with four parameters , as a cumulative distribution function . <S>
We have analyzed the available data for China and Italy . <S>
The evolution in time of the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19 in China very well approximates a distribution of the type of the error function ,
that is , the integral of a normal , Gaussian distribution . <S>
We have then used such a function
to study the potential evolution in time of the number of positive cases in Italy
by performing a number of fits of the official data so far available . <S>
We then found a statistical prediction for the day
in which the peak of the number of daily positive cases in Italy occurs ,
corresponding to the flex of the fit ,
that is , to the change in sign of its second derivative
( i.e. , the change from acceleration to deceleration ) ,
as well as of the day
in which a substantial attenuation of such number of daily cases is reached . <S>
We have also analyzed the predictions of the cumulative number of fatalities in both China and Italy ,
obtaining consistent results . <S>
We have then performed 150 Monte Carlo simulations
to have a more robust prediction of the day of the above - mentioned peak and of the day of the substantial decrease in the number of daily positive cases and fatalities . <S>
Although official data have been used ,
those predictions are obtained with a heuristic approach
since they are based on a statistical approach
and do not take into account either a number of relevant issues
( such as number of daily nasopharyngeal swabs , medical , social distancing , virological and epidemiological )
or models of contamination diffusion . <S> <P>
