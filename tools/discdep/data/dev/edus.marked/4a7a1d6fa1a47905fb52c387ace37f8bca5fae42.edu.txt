Background : <S>
Hospitalized bronchiolitis imposes a significant burden among infants , particularly among Indigenous children . <S>
Traditional or known risk factors for severe disease are well described ,
but there are limited data on risks for prolonged hospitalization and persistent symptoms . <S>
Our aims were to determine factors ( clinical and microbiological ) associated with ( i ) prolonged length of stay ( LOS ) ; ( ii ) persistent respiratory symptoms at 3 weeks ; ( iii ) bronchiectasis up to $ 24 months post - hospitalisation ; and ( iv ) risk of respiratory readmissions within 6 months . <S>
Methods : <S>
Indigenous infants
hospitalized with bronchiolitis
were enrolled at Royal Darwin Hospital between 2008 and 2013 . <S>
Standardized forms were used
to record clinical data . <S>
A nasopharyngeal swab was collected at enrolment
to identify respiratory viruses and bacteria . <S>
Results : <S>
The median age of 232 infants was 5 months
( interquartile range 3 - 9 ) ;
65 % male . <S>
On multivariate regression , our 12 point severity score
( including accessory muscle use )
was the only factor
associated with prolonged LOS
but the effect was modest
( þ3.0 hr per point , 95%CI : 0.7 , 5.1 , P ¼ 0.01 ) . <S>
Presence of cough at 3 weeks increased the odds of bronchiectasis
( OR 3.0 , 95%CI : 1.1 , 7.0 , P ¼ 0.03 ) . <S>
Factors
associated with respiratory readmissions
were : previous respiratory hospitalization
( OR 2.3 , 95%CI : 1.0 , 5.4 , P ¼ 0.05 )
and household smoke
( OR 2.6 , 95%CI : 1.0 , 6.3 , P ¼ 0.04 ) . <S>
Conclusion : <S>
Increased severity score is associated with prolonged LOS in Indigenous children
hospitalized with bronchiolitis . <S>
As persistent symptoms at 3 weeks post - hospitalization are associated with future diagnosis of bronchiectasis ,
optimising clinical care beyond hospitalization is needed
to improve long - term respiratory outcomes for infants at risk of respiratory disease . <S> <P>
