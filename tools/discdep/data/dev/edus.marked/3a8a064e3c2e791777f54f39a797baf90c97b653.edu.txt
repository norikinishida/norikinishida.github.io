The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in many hospitals and practices to cancel in - person outpatient clinic visits ,
where head and neck patients receive their critical longitudinal care . <S>
Out of necessity , most practices have been encouraged to use telemedicine as a method
to maintain a continuum of care with their patients . <S>
As a result , the prevalence of telemedicine has grown rapidly during this pandemic ,
without allowing the physicians and patients to be adequately educated on how best to utilize the services . <S>
There is a steep learning curve as we have learned ,
and our goal is to provide guidelines for both patients and physicians , as well as a valuable patient handout in preparation for their visit . <S> <P>
