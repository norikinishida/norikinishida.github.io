Functional protein microarrays are emerging as a promising new tool for large - scale and highthroughput studies . <S>
In this article , we will review their applications in basic proteomics research ,
where various types of assays have been developed
to probe binding activities to other biomolecules ,
such as proteins , DNA , RNA , small molecules , and glycans . <S>
We will also report recent progress
of using functional protein microarrays
in profiling protein posttranslational modifications ,
including phosphorylation , ubiquitylation , acetylation , and nitrosylation . <S>
Finally , we will discuss potential of functional protein microarrays in biomarker identification and clinical diagnostics . <S>
We strongly believe
that functional protein microarrays will soon become an indispensible and invaluable tool in proteomics research and systems biology . <S> <P>
