Motivated by the covid-19 pandemic ,
we developed a novel Shewhart chart
to visualize and learn from variation in reported deaths in an epidemic . <S> <P>
Without a method
to understand
if day - to - day variation in outcomes may be attributed to meaningful signals of change
- rather than variability we would expect -
care providers , improvement leaders , policy - makers , and the public will struggle to recognize
if epidemic conditions are improving . <S> <P>
We developed a novel hybrid C - Chart and I - Chart
to detect within a geographic area the start and end of exponential growth in reported deaths . <S>
Reported deaths were the unit of analysis
owing to erratic reporting of cases from variability in local testing strategies . <S>
We used simulation and case studies
to assess chart performance
and define technical parameters . <S>
This approach also applies to other critical measures
related to a pandemic
when high - quality data are available . <S> <P>
The hybrid chart detected the start of exponential growth
and identified early signals
that the growth phase was ending . <S>
During a pandemic , timely reliable signals
that an epidemic is waxing or waning
may have mortal implications . <S>
This novel chart offers a practical tool ,
accessible to system leaders and front - line teams ,
to visualize and learn from daily reported deaths during an epidemic . <S>
Without Shewhart charts and , more broadly , a theory of variation in our epidemiological arsenal ,
we lack a scientific method for real - time assessment of local conditions . <S>
Shewhart charts should become a standard method
for learning from data in the context of a pandemic or epidemic . <S> <P>
