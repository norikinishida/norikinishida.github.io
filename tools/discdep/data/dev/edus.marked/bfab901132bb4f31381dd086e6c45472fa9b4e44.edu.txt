A simulation tool
that supports developers to build scenarios automatically in multiple simulation platforms
is proposed . <S>
As an essential part of this simulator , this study proposed an activity schedule generator
to mimic the daily life of elderly people
living alone . <S>
This generator outperforms existing methods of activity schedule planning in three aspects : <S>
1 ) it is adaptive to the layout of a simulated smart house ; <S>
2 ) there is no unspecified time in the timeline of generated schedules ; <S>
and 3 ) it generates stable , but not tedious schedules for a number of days . <S>
A real - time location data generator is proposed
to convert generated schedules to simulated real - time location data of the resident ,
and a proposed interface converts these simulated location data to simulated records of virtual passive infrared ( PIR ) sensors ,
which can be used
to optimize placement of PIR sensors in a smart house . <S> <P>
