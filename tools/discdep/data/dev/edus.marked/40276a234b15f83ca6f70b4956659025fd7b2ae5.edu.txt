Background : <S>
HRV infections are generally self - limiting in healthy subjects ,
whereas in immunocompromised hosts HRV infections can lead to severe complications and persistent infections . <S>
The persistence of HRV shedding could be due to the inefficient immunological control of a single infectious episode . <S>
Objectives : <S>
To investigate the clinical , virologic and immunologic characteristics of pediatric HSCT recipients with HRV - PI infection . <S>
Study design : <S>
During the period 2006 - 2012 , eight hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipients presented with persistent rhinovirus infection
( HRV - PI , ≥30 days ) . <S>
Viral load and T - CD4 + , T - CD8 + , B and NK lymphocyte counts at the onset of infection were compared with those of fourteen HSCT recipients with acute HRV infection
( HRV - AI , ≤15 days ) . <S>
Results : <S>
The median duration of HRV positivity in patients with HRV - PI was 61 days
( range 30 - 174 days )
and phylogenetic analysis showed the persistence of a single HRV type in all patients
( 100 % ) . <S>
In HSCT recipients with HRV - PI , T - CD4 + , T - CD8 + and NK cell counts at the onset of infection were significantly lower than those
observed in recipients with HRV - AI
( p < 0.01 ) ,
while B cell counts were similar in the two groups
( p = 0.25 ) . <S>
A decrease in HRV load was associated with a significant increase in T - CD4 + , T - CD8 + and NK lymphocyte counts in HRV - PI patients
( p < 0.01 ) . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
This study suggests a role for cellular immunity in HRV clearance
and highlights the importance of its recovery for the control of HRV infection in HSCT recipients . <S> <P>
