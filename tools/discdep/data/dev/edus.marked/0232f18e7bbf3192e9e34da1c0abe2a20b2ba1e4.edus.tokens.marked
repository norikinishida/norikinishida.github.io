Herein , the LASSBio Chemical Library is presented as a valuable source of compounds for screening
to identify hits suitable for subsequent hit - to - lead optimization stages . <S>
A feature of the LASSBio Chemical Library worth highlighting is the fact
that it is a smart library
designed by medicinal chemists with pharmacological activity as the main priority . <S>
The great majority of the compounds part of this library have shown in vivo activity in animal models ,
which is an indication
that they possess overall favorable bioavailability properties and , hence , adequate pharmacokinetic profiles . <S>
This , in turn , is supported by the fact
that approximately 85 % of the compounds are compliant with Lipinski 's rule of five and ca . <S>
95 % are compliant with Veber 's rules , two important guidelines for oral bioavailability . <S>
In this work it is presented a virtual screening methodology combining a pharmacophore - based model and an empirical Gibbs free energy - based model for the ligand - protein interaction to explore the LASSBio Chemical Library as a source of new hits for the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ ( PI4KIIIβ ) enzyme ,
which is related to the development of viral infections
( including enteroviruses , SARS coronavirus , and hepatitis C virus ) ,
cancers and neurological diseases . <S>
The approach resulted in the identification of two hits , LASSBio-1799 ( 7 ) and LASSBio-1814 ( 10 ) ,
which inhibited the target enzyme with IC 50 values of 3.66 μM and IC 50 and 6.09 μM , respectively . <S>
This study also enabled the determination of the structural requirements for interactions with the active site of PI4KIIIβ ,
demonstrating the importance of both acceptor and donor hydrogen bonding groups
for forming interactions with binding site residues Val598 and Lys549 . <S> <P>
