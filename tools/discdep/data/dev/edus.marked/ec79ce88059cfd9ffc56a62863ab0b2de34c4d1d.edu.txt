Background : <S>
Public health and health promotion rely on many different interventions ,
which range from health education and communication , through community mobilisation and changes to environmental conditions , to legal and fiscal actions . <S>
The introduction of the increased tax on sugar - sweetened beverages ( SSB ) ,
popularly called sugar tax ( ST ) ,
and a mandatory programme of vaccinations are the strategies
inciting the most vivid discussions in Polish society . <S>
The study was intended to assess the determinants of the attitudes of Polish society
regarding the ST and to vaccinations . <S>
Methods : <S>
For the analysis , the data
originating from the survey of a representative adult sample of Polish society
( n = 1000 )
was used . <S>
The survey was based on computer - assisted telephone interviewing ( CATI ) . <S>
The assessment of the relationships between the selected variables and the opinions about the introduction of the ST and the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations were carried out
using the chi 2 test and univariate logistic regression models . <S>
Results : <S>
The acceptance of the ST and vaccination showed a significant relationship to the level of health literacy ( HL ) but not to eHealth literacy ( eHL ) . <S>
Respondents
having a higher rather than lower HL ; older rather than younger ; married rather than singles ; retired , or on a disability pension , rather than vocationally active and nonusers of the Internet rather than users
were more likely to show an acceptance for both interventions . <S>
Those
more frequently using health care services
and those with chronic diseases showed a greater belief in the safety and effectiveness of vaccinations . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
The relationship between the opinions of the two public health interventions analysed and the sociodemographic variables demonstrated similar patterns . <S>
Interestingly , the opinions were associated only with HL and not with eHL
and users of the Internet were more sceptical about the interventions . <S> <P>
