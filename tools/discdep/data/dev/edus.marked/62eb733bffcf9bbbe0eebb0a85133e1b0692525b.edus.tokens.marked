One hundred and sixty - eight ganglia from 54 cattle aged 10 days to 10 years were examined microscopically . <S>
Samples from six autonomic ganglia and one sensory ganglion were represented . <S>
Thirteen animals were clinically normal
and 41 were submitted for post - mortem examination . <S>
Neuronal vacuolation , spheroid formation , lipofuscin accumulation and central chromatolysis were observed sporadically
and were of varying magnitude . <S>
Neuronal vacuolation and spheroid formation were not age - related changes ,
while lipofuscin accumulation was more common in older animals
and central chromatolysis was more common in younger cattle . <S>
Nonsuppurative inflammation and neuronophagia were also common findings
( 23 out of 54 animals , 42.6 % )
in autonomic ganglia
that did not contain herpesvirus DNA
as determined by polymerase chain reaction . <S>
Renaut bodies , features of peripheral nerves , were most commonly noted in the vagus . <S>
None of the histopathological findings were related to any particular disease
in which loss of autonomic nervous system function might be expected . <S>
Furthermore , all changes were as common in clinically normal animals as in animals with disease . <S> <P>
