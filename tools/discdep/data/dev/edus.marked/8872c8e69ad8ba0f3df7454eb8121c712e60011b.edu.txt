A central nervous system ( CNS ) disorder
characterized by non - suppurative encephalomyelitis with neurological signs
was induced experimentally in gnotobiotic pigs by intravenous and oral or intranasal inoculation of the porcine teschovirus ( PTV ) Toyama 2002 strain
isolated from breeding pigs in Japan . <S>
Lesions
consisting of perivascular cuffing of mononuclear cells , focal gliosis , neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia
were observed in the brainstem , cerebellum and spinal cord . <S>
Non - suppurative ganglionitis in the spinal ganglion and neuritis in the spinal root were also observed . <S>
Regardless of the route of inoculation ,
all pigs
infected experimentally with PTV
showed a similar distribution of CNS lesions . <S>
Histological lesions in the CNS
caused by oral or intranasal inoculation of the virus
were mild
compared with those
induced by intravenous infection . <S>
Immunohistochemically , the distribution of PTV antigens corresponded closely with the distribution of brain lesions . <S>
PTV particles were detected via electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of nerve cells and the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the spinal cord of inoculated pigs . <S>
Polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated the presence of PTV RNA in the CNS , tonsils and large intestines of 21 of the 22 pigs inoculated . <S>
Direct CNS invasion via the blood vessels appears to be a major route of infection for PTV . <S>
The gnotobiotic pig provides a useful model for further study of PTV pathogenesis . <S> <P>
