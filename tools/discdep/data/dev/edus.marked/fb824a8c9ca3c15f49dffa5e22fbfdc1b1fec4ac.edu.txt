As Sun Tzu wrote in The Art of War ,
" All warfare is based on deception " . <S>
He could have easily been describing the ancient battle between virus and host rather than on the lore of Chinese warfare . <S>
A virus must infect ,
replicate
and spread
for it to survive ;
the host attempting to thwart it at every step of the way . <S>
This ancient battle has been waged for millions of years
and has spawned an innumerable number of viruses , each with their own unique ways
of trying to outsmart the host . <S>
Some viruses encode proteins
that directly inhibit / degrade / alter host pathways
and some simply have evolved ways
to hide from the hosts detection system . <S>
The host is not passive in this battle . <S>
It has evolved complex pathways and redundant mechanisms
to respond to viral interlopers . <S> <P>
