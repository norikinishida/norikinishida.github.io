Most biological processes are described as a series of interactions between proteins and other molecules ,
and interactions are in turn described in terms of atomic structures . <S>
To annotate protein functions as sets of interaction states at atomic resolution ,
and thereby to better understand the relation between protein interactions and biological functions ,
we conducted exhaustive all - against - all atomic structure comparisons of all known binding sites for ligands
including small molecules , proteins and nucleic acids ,
and identified recurring elementary motifs . <S>
By integrating the elementary motifs
associated with each subunit ,
we defined composite motifs
that represent context - dependent combinations of elementary motifs . <S>
It is demonstrated that function similarity can be better inferred from composite motif similarity
compared to the similarity of protein sequences or of individual binding sites . <S>
By integrating the composite motifs
associated with each protein function ,
we define meta - composite motifs
each of which is regarded as a time - independent diagrammatic representation of a biological process . <S>
It is shown that meta - composite motifs provide richer annotations of biological processes than sequence clusters . <S>
The present results serve as a basis
for bridging atomic structures to higher - order biological phenomena
by classification and integration of binding site structures . <S> <P>
