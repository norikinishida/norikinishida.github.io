Two recently detected viruses , human metapneumovirus ( hMPV ) and coronavirus NL63 ( HCoV - NL63 ) , have been associated with acute respiratory tract infections , particularly in young children . <S>
This study investigated the frequency of hMPV and HCoV - NL63 infections in Swedish children
by screening 221 nasopharyngeal aspirates ,
collected between November 2003 and May 2005 , from 212 children
attending the paediatric department of a county hospital in Sweden
or submitted from local general practitioners . <S>
The samples were originally submitted
to be tested for respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) ,
and were examined retrospectively for hMPV and HCoV - NL63 by RT - PCR . <S>
Of the 212 patients , 101 were positive for RSV
( 48 % ) ,
22 ( 10 % )
were positive for hMPV ,
and 12
( 6 % )
were positive for HCoV - NL63 . <S>
The frequency of HCoV - NL63 infection increased from 1 % in 2003 - 2004 to 10 % in 2004 - 2005 . <S>
Sequence analysis of parts of the coronavirus genomes showed considerable similarity to the HCoV - NL63 prototype sequence . <S>
The study demonstrated
that HCoV - NL63 and hMPV occur in south - west Sweden with essentially the same frequency , seasonal distribution and clinical characteristics
as have been reported in other countries . <S> <P>
