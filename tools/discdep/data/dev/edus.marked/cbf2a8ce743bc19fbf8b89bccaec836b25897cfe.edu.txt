Compelling evidence supports the role of oxidative stress in Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) pathophysiology . <S>
Interestingly , Herpes simplex virus-1 ( HSV-1 ) , a neurotropic virus
that establishes a lifelong latent infection in the trigeminal ganglion
followed by periodic reactivations ,
has been reportedly linked both to AD and to oxidative stress conditions . <S>
Herein , we analyzed , through biochemical and redox proteomic approaches , the mouse model of recurrent HSV-1 infection
we previously set up ,
to investigate
whether multiple virus reactivations induced oxidative stress in the mouse brain
and affected protein function and related intracellular pathways . <S>
Following multiple HSV-1 reactivations ,
we found in mouse brains increased levels of oxidative stress hallmarks ,
including 4-hydroxynonenal ( HNE ) , and 13 HNE - modified proteins
whose levels were found significantly altered in the cortex of HSV-1-infected mice
compared to controls . <S>
We focused on two proteins
previously linked to AD pathogenesis ,
i.e. , glucose - regulated protein 78 ( GRP78 ) and collapsin response - mediated protein 2 ( CRMP2 ) ,
which are involved in the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) and in microtubule stabilization , respectively . <S>
We found
that recurrent HSV-1 infection disables GRP78 function
and activates the UPR ,
whereas it prevents CRMP2 function in mouse brains . <S>
Overall , these data suggest
that repeated HSV-1 reactivation into the brain may contribute to neurodegeneration also through oxidative damage . <S> <P>
