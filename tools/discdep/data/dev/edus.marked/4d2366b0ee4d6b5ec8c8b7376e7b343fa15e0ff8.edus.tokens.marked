Until recently , conventional culture techniques and immunofluorecence assays were considered the gold standard for the detection of respiratory viruses ,
even though results are mostly available too late
or lacked specificity and sensitivity . <S>
These methods are now widely replaced with appropriate DNA - and RNA - based amplification techniques , in particular real time PCR amplification , for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for acute respiratory infections . <S>
Real - time PCR offers rapid results , efficiencies in work flow and a reduced risk of false positive results
due to contamination . <S>
As a result , better patient management or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration will be possible
leading to enhanced efficiencies in health care . <S>
In applying molecular methods to diagnostic use ,
the laboratory can optimise its diagnostic strategy
by applying a combination of real - time amplification tests for respiratory viruses and the non - viral respiratory bacterial pathogens . <S>
However this must be done within a context of resource availability , technical expertise available and clinical utility . <S>
It seems certain that molecular microbiology will continue to develop ,
leading to further applications in diagnostic technology ,
thereby improving our understanding of disease processes
and enhancing our knowledge of the pathogens responsible . <S> <P>
