The availability of monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) specific for the SARS - coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) is important
for the development of both diagnostic tools and treatment of infection . <S>
A molecular characterization of nine monoclonal antibodies
raised in immune mice ,
using highly purified , inactivated SARS - CoV as the inoculating antigen ,
is presented in this report . <S>
These antibodies are specific for numerous viral protein targets ,
and six of them are able to effectively neutralize SARS - CoV in vitro ,
including one with a neutralizing titre of 0.075 nM. <S>
A phylogenetic analysis of the heavy and light chain sequences reveals
that the mAbs share considerable homology . <S>
The majority of the heavy chains belong to a single Ig germline V - gene family ,
while considerably more sequence variation is evident in the light chain sequences . <S>
These analyses demonstrate
that neutralization ability can be correlated with specific murine V H -gene alleles . <S>
For instance , one evident trend is high sequence conservation in the V H chains of the neutralizing mAbs , particularly in CDR-1 and CDR-2 . <S>
The results suggest
that optimization of murine mAbs for neutralization of SARS - CoV infection will likely be possible ,
and will aid in the development of diagnostic tools and passive treatments for SARS - CoV infection . <S> <P>
