In early 2013 , a novel avian - origin influenza A(H7N9 ) virus emerged in China ,
and has caused sporadic human infections . <S>
The incubation period is the delay from infection until onset of symptoms ,
and varies from person to person . <S>
Few previous studies have examined
whether the duration of the incubation period correlates with subsequent disease severity . <S> <P>
We analyzed data of period of exposure on 395 human cases of laboratory - confirmed influenza A(H7N9 ) virus infection in China in a Bayesian framework
using a Weibull distribution . <S>
We found a longer incubation period for the 173 fatal cases with a mean of 3.7 days
( 95 % credibility interval , CrI : 3.4 - 4.1 ) ,
compared to a mean of 3.3 days
( 95 % CrI : 2.9 - 3.6 )
for the 222 non - fatal cases ,
and the difference in means was marginally significant at 0.47 days
( 95 % CrI : -0.04 , 0.99 ) . <S>
There was a statistically significant correlation between a longer incubation period and an increased risk of death after adjustment for age , sex , geographical location and underlying medical conditions <S>
( adjusted odds ratio 1.70 per day increase in incubation period ;
95 % credibility interval 1.47 - 1.97 ) . <S> <P>
We found a significant association between a longer incubation period and a greater risk of death among human H7N9 cases . <S>
The underlying biological mechanisms
leading to this association
deserve further exploration . <S> <P>
