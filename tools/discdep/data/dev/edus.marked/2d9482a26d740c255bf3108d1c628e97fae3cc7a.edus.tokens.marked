The canine respiratory coronavirus ( CRCoV ) K37 strain of the family Coronaviridae , group 2 , was isolated in South Korea . <S>
Its genome was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing
and was determined to have 31,029 bp . <S>
The small open reading frames
situated between the spike and envelope genes of most of the CRCoV strains
( except the CRCoV 4180 strain )
were found to encode three nonstructural proteins
( 4.9 kDa , 2.7 kDa , and 12.8 kDa ) ,
while those of bovine coronavirus ( BCoV ) encode another three nonstructural proteins
( 4.9 kDa , 4.8 kDa , and 12.7 kDa )
and those of a recently isolated bovine respiratory coronavirus ( BRCoV ) were found to encode only two nonstructural proteins
( 4.9 kDa and 12.7 kDa ) . <S>
The differences in the genes
encoding these small nonstructural proteins
may be associated with the emergence of highly similar viruses in different hosts . <S> <P>
