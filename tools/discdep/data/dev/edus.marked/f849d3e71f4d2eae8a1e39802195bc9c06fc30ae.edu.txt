Background : <S>
Viral respiratory infection ( VRI ) is a common contraindication to elective surgery . <S>
Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients ( PSPs ) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases
and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases . <S>
The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure . <S>
Methods : <S>
We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children
( under 18 years of age )
with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019 . <S>
We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post - surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group
using a quantitative real - time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) assay panel . <S>
We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load
to investigate the association between viruses , symptoms and viral quantity in qRT - PCR - positive PSPs . <S>
Results : <S>
Out of 1629 children enrolled , a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171
( 10.50 % )
PSPs
including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery . <S>
Commonly detected viruses were human rhino / enterovirus
( HRV / EV , 42.19 % ) ,
parainfluenza virus 3
( PIV3 , 24.48 % ) ,
coronavirus
( CoV NL63 , OC43 , HKU1 , 11.46 % ) ,
and respiratory syncytial virus
( RSV , 9.9 % ) . <S>
PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs
presenting with mild symptoms ,
progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery . <S>
HRV / EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs . <S>
CoV ( OC43 , HKU1 ) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
Our study suggested
that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs . <S>
Employing a more comprehensive , sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses
in order to guide optimal surgical timing . <S> <P>
