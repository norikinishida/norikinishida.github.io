Streptobacillus felis is a fastidious microorganism and a novel member of the potentially zoonotic bacteria
causing rat bite fever . <S>
Since its description , this is the second isolation of S. felis in a diseased member of the Felidae . <S>
Interestingly , the strain from this study was isolated from a zoo held , rusty - spotted cat
( Prionailurus rubiginosus ) ,
with pneumonia ,
thereby indicating a possible broader host range in feline species . <S>
A recent preliminary sampling of domestic cats
( Felis silvestris forma catus )
revealed
that this microorganism is common in the oropharynx ,
suggesting
that S. felis is a member of their normal microbiota . <S>
Due to unawareness , fastidiousness , antibiotic sensitivity and lack of diagnostics
the role of S. felis as a cat and human pathogen might be underreported as with other Streptobacillus infections . <S>
More studies are necessary
to elucidate the role of S. felis in domestic cats and other Felidae
in order to better estimate its zoonotic potential . <S> <P>
