Since it emerged in Brazil in May 2015 ,
the mosquito - borne Zika virus ( ZIKV ) has raised global concern
due to its association with a significant rise in the number of infants born with microcephaly and neurological disorders
such as Guillain - Barr√© syndrome <S>
We developed prototype subunit and adenoviral - based Zika vaccines
encoding the extracellular portion of the ZIKV envelope gene ( E )
fused to the T4 fibritin foldon trimerization domain ( Efl ) . <S>
The subunit vaccine was delivered intradermally through carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle array ( MNA ) . <S>
The immunogenicity of these two vaccines ,
named Ad5 . ZIKV - Efl and ZIKV - rEfl ,
was tested in C57BL/6 mice . <S>
Prime / boost immunization regimen was associated with induction of a ZIKV - specific antibody response ,
which provided neutralizing immunity . <S>
Moreover , protection was evaluated in seven - day - old pups after virulent ZIKV intraperitoneal challenge . <S>
Pups
born to mice
immunized with Ad5 . ZIKV - Efl
were all protected against lethal challenge infection
without weight loss or neurological signs ,
while pups
born to dams
immunized with MNA - ZIKV - rEfl
were partially protected
( 50 % ) . <S>
No protection was seen in pups
born to phosphate buffered saline - immunized mice . <S>
This study illustrates the preliminary efficacy of the E ZIKV antigen vaccination
in controlling ZIKV infectivity ,
providing a promising candidate vaccine and antigen format for the prevention of Zika virus disease . <S> <P>
