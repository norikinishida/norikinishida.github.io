The first person - to - person transmission of the 2019-novel coronavirus in Italy on 21 February 2020 led to an infection chain
that represents one of the largest known COVID-19 outbreaks outside Asia . <S>
Hospitals have been forced to reorganized their units in response
to prepare for an unforeseen healthcare emergency . <S>
In this context , our laboratory
( Molecular and Genomic Diagnostics Unit , Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS )
re - modulated its priorities
by temporarily interrupting most of the molecular tests
guaranteeing only those
considered " urgent "
and not postponable . <S>
In particular , this paper details changes
regarding the execution of germline BRCA ( gBRCA ) testing in our laboratory . <S>
A substantial reduction in gBRCA testing
( about 60 % )
compared to the first 2 months of the current year
was registered ,
but the requests have not been reset . <S>
The requesting physicians were mainly gynaecologists and oncologists . <S>
These evidences further emphasize the new era of gBRCA testing in the management of cancer patients
and confirms definitively the integration of gBRCA testing / Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) into clinical oncology . <S>
Finally , a re - organization of gBRCA testing in our Unit ,
mainly related to delayed and reduced arrival of tests
was necessary ,
ensuring , however , a high - quality standard and reliability ,
mandatory for gBRCA testing in a clinical setting . <S> <P>
