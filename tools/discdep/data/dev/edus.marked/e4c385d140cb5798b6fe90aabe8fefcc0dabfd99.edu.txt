Surface modified bioactive virus - mimicking organic nanovesicles represent themselves as complex biomimetic structures
that have abilities
to dissect the functions of individual entities in a complex biochemical system . <S>
The customized surface of nanovesicles from ( glyco)dendrimersomes has structural modifications
that contribute to manifest the SARS - CoV-2 and host pathogenic molecular interactions
that help the virus to evade the human immune system . <S>
Nanovesicles also have a potential role in dynamic biomedical applications
such as designing galectin targeting drugs , evaluation of antibodies
to design antiviral therapeutics or vaccines
and targeted delivery of drugs . <S> <P>
