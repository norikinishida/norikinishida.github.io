Background : <S>
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) has infected more than 40 million people worldwide , mainly in sub - Saharan Africa . <S>
The high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern Africa necessitates the development of cheap , effective vaccines . <S>
One means of production is the use of plants ,
for which a number of different techniques have been successfully developed . <S>
HIV-1 Pr55Gag is a promising HIV-1 vaccine candidate : <S>
we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag ( p17 / p24 ) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp .
using transgenic plants and transient expression via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and recombinant tobamovirus vectors . <S>
We also investigated the influence of subcellular localisation of recombinant protein to the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) on protein yield . <S>
We partially purified a selected vaccine candidate
and tested its stimulation of a humoral and cellular immune response in mice . <S> <P>
Both transient and transgenic expression of the HIV antigens were successful ,
although expression of Pr55Gag was low in all systems ; <S>
however , the Agrobacterium - mediated transient expression of p24 and p17 / p24 yielded best , to more than 1 mg p24 / kg fresh weight . <S>
Chloroplast targeted protein levels were highest in transient and transgenic expression of p24 and p17 / p24 . <S>
The transiently - expressed p17 / p24 was not immunogenic in mice as a homologous vaccine ,
but it significantly boosted a humoral and T cell immune response
primed by a gag DNA vaccine , pTHGagC. <S> <P>
Conclusion : <S>
Transient agroinfiltration was best for expression of all of the recombinant proteins tested ,
and p24 and p17 / p24 were expressed at much higher levels than Pr55Gag . <S>
Our results highlight the usefulness of plastid signal peptides
in enhancing the production of recombinant proteins
meant for use as vaccines . <S>
The p17 / p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice
primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC ,
showing
that this plant - produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine . <S> <P>
