Background : <S>
Acute viral necrosis virus ( AVNV ) is the causative agent of a serious disease
resulting in high mortality in cultured Chinese scallops , Chlamys farreri . <S>
We have sequenced and analyzed the complete genome of AVNV . <S>
Results : <S>
The AVNV genome is a linear , double - stranded DNA molecule of 210,993 bp with a nucleotide composition of 38.5 % G + C. <S>
A total of 123 open reading frames were predicted
to encode functional proteins ,
ranging from 41 to 1,878 amino acid residues . <S>
The DNA sequence of AVNV is 97 % identical to that of ostreid herpesvirus 1 ( OsHV-1 ) ,
and the amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins of these two viruses are 94 - 100 % identical . <S>
The genomic organization of AVNV is similar to that of OsHV-1 ,
and consists of two unique regions
( 170.4 kb and 3.4 kb , respectively ) ,
each flanked by two inverted repeats
( 7.6 kb and 10.2 kb , respectively ) ,
with a third unique region ( 1.5 kb )
situated between the two internal repeats . <S>
Conclusions : <S>
Our results indicate
that AVNV is a variant of OsHV-1 . <S>
The AVNV genome sequence provides information useful
for understanding the evolution and divergence of OsHV-1 in marine molluscs . <S> <P>
