The Scutellaria species ( Lamiaceae ) is used as a source of flavonoids
to treat a variety of diseases in traditional medicine . <S>
In spite of many reports about the cytotoxic and antitumor effects of some species of this genus ,
anticancer researches on one of the Iranian species S. litwinowii have not yet been conducted . <S>
The cytotoxic properties of total methanol extract of S. litwinowii and its fractions were investigated on different cancer cell lines
including AGS , HeLa , MCF-7 , PC12 and NIH 3T3 . <S>
Meanwhile , the role of apoptosis in this toxicity was explored . <S>
The cells were cultured in DMEM medium
and incubated with different concentrations of herb plant extracts . <S>
Cell viability was quantitated by MTT assay . <S>
Apoptotic cells were determined
using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry ( sub - G1 peak ) . <S>
Scutellaria litwinowii inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a dose - dependent manner . <S>
Among solvent fractions of S. litwinowii , the methylene chloride fraction was found to be more toxic
compared to other fractions . <S>
The IC 50 values of this fraction against AGS , HeLa , MCF-7 and PC12 cell lines after 24 h were determined , 121.2 ± 3.1 , 40.9 ± 2.5 , 115.9 ± 3.5 and 64.5 ± 3.4 μg / ml , respectively . <S>
Scutellaria litwinowii induced a sub - G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram of treated cells
compared to control cells
indicating
that apoptotic cell death is involved in S. litwinowii toxicity . <S>
Scutellaria litwinowii exerts cytotoxic and proapototic effects in a variety of malignant cell lines
and could be considered as a potential chemotherapeutic agent in cancer treatment . <S> <P>
