The mechanisms of inflammation and cancer are intertwined by complex networks of signaling pathways . <S>
Dysregulations in the Janus kinase / signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK / STAT ) pathway underlie several pathogenic conditions
related to chronic inflammatory states , autoimmune diseases and cancer . <S>
Historically , the potential application of JAK inhibition has been thoroughly explored ,
thus triggering an escalation of favorable results in this field . <S>
So far , five JAK inhibitors have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for the treatment of different diseases . <S>
Considering the complexity of JAK - depending processes and their involvement in multiple disorders ,
JAK inhibitors are the perfect candidates for drug repurposing and for the assessment of multitarget strategies . <S>
Herein we reviewed the recent progress
concerning JAK inhibition ,
including the innovations
provided by the release of JAKs crystal structures
and the improvement of synthetic strategies
aimed to simplify of the industrial scale - up . <S> <P>
