Feline infectious peritonitis is a devastating , fatal disease of domestic cats
caused by a pathogenic mutant virus
derived from the ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus ( FECV ) . <S>
Infection by FECV is generally subclinical ,
and little is known about the mucosal immune response
that controls and eliminates the virus . <S>
We investigated the mucosal immune response against FECV in an endemically infected breeding colony over a seven - month period . <S>
Thirty - three cats were grouped according to FECV seropositivity and fecal virus shedding into naïve / immunologically quiescent , convalescent and actively infected groups . <S>
Blood , fecal samples and colon biopsies were collected
to assess the mucosal and systemic immunologic and virologic profile . <S>
Results showed
that cats with active FECV infections have strong systemic IgG and mucosal IgA responses
that wane after virus clearance . <S>
Significant FECV - specific mucosal T cell IFNγ responses were not detected in any of the three groups . <S>
A shift toward an inflammatory state in the mucosa was suggested by increased IL17 : FoxP3 expression . <S>
However , no histologic abnormalities were observed ,
and no shifts in lymphocyte subpopulation phenotype or proliferation were noted . <S>
Together , the results suggest
that control of FECV is mediated by humoral mucosal and systemic responses
and that perturbations in the primary reservoir organ ( colon ) are minimal . <S> <P>
