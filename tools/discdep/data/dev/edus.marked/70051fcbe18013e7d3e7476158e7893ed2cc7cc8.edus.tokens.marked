Knowledge about the molecular basis of SARS - CoV-2 infection is incipient . <S>
However , recent experimental results about the virus interactome have shown
that this single - positive stranded RNA virus produces a set of about 28 specific proteins
grouped into 16 non - structural proteins
( Nsp1 to Nsp16 ) ,
four structural proteins
( E , M , N , and S ) ,
and eight accessory proteins
( orf3a , orf6 , orf7a , orf7b , orf8 , orf9b , orf9c , and orf10 ) . <S>
In this brief communication , the network model of the interactome of these viral proteins with the host proteins is analyzed . <S>
The statistical analysis of this network shows
that it has a modular scale - free topology
in which the virus proteins orf8 , M , and Nsp7 are the three nodes with the most connections ( links ) . <S>
This result suggests the possibility
that a simultaneous pharmacological attack on these hubs could assure the destruction of the network and the elimination of the virus . <S> <P>
