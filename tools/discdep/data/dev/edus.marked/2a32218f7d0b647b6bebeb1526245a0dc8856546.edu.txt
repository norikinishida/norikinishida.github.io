The cell intrinsic innate immune responses provide a first line of defense against viral infection ,
and often function
by targeting cellular pathways
usurped by the virus during infection . <S>
In particular , many viruses manipulate cellular lipids
to form complex structures
required for viral replication ,
many of which are dependent on de novo fatty acid synthesis . <S>
We found
that the energy regulator AMPK ,
which potently inhibits fatty acid synthesis ,
restricts infection of the Bunyavirus , Rift Valley Fever Virus ( RVFV ) , an important re - emerging arthropod - borne human pathogen
for which there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics . <S>
We show restriction of RVFV both by AMPK and its upstream activator LKB1 ,
indicating an antiviral role for this signaling pathway . <S>
Furthermore , we found
that AMPK is activated during RVFV infection ,
leading to the phosphorylation and inhibition of acetyl - CoA carboxylase , the first rate - limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis . <S>
Activating AMPK pharmacologically both restricted infection
and reduced lipid levels . <S>
This restriction could be bypassed by treatment with the fatty acid palmitate ,
demonstrating
that AMPK restricts RVFV infection through its inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis . <S>
Lastly , we found
that this pathway plays a broad role in antiviral defense
since additional viruses from disparate families were also restricted by AMPK and LKB1 . <S>
Therefore , AMPK is an important component of the cell intrinsic immune response
that restricts infection through a novel mechanism
involving the inhibition of fatty acid metabolism . <S> <P>
