H1N1 swine influenza viruses ( SIV ) are prevalent in pigs globally ,
and occasionally emerge in humans ,
which raises concern about their pandemic threats . <S>
To stimulate hemagglutination ( HA ) of A / Swine / Guangdong / LM/2004 ( H1N1 ) ( SW / GD/04 ) antibody response ,
eukaryotic expression plasmid pCI - neo - HA was constructed
and used as an immunogen
to prepare monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) . <S>
Five mAbs
( designed 8C4 , 8C6 , 9D6 , 8A4 , and 8B1 )
against HA protein were obtained
and characterized . <S>
Western blot showed
that the 70 kDa HA protein could be detected by all mAbs in MDCK cells
infected with SW / GD/04 . <S>
Three mAbs-8C4 , 8C6 , and 9D6-have hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) and neutralization test ( NT ) activities , and 8C6 induces the highest HI and NT titers . <S>
The protection efficacy of 8C6 was investigated in BALB / c mice
challenged with homologous or heterologous strains of the H1 subtype SIV . <S>
The results indicate
that mAb 8C6 protected the mice from viral infections , especially the homologous strain ,
which was clearly demonstrated by the body weight changes and reduction of viral load . <S>
Thus , our findings document for the first time
that mAb 8C6 might be of potential therapeutic value for H1 subtype SIV infection . <S> <P>
