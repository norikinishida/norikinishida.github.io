The present study is intended to analyze the effect of global quality , perceived value , general satisfaction , and emotions on future behavior patterns among participants in the European Duathlon Championship . <S>
In this sense , a questionnaire was administered
( n = 210 ) ,
composed of four sections :
essential demographic and profiling variables , perceived quality , overall quality , and emotions . <S>
Consequently , a relational model was designed
to be examined by means of structural equation modeling ( SEM ) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis ( fsQCA ) . <S>
Results reveal
that global quality and general satisfaction are key dimensions
for determining future behaviors of participants ,
but not so the perceived value . <S>
Moreover , up to three combinations of these dimensions together with emotions
- pleasure and arousal -
emerged as enough for depicting future intentions to a great extent . <S>
In this line , a remarkably sufficient combination consists of global quality , general satisfaction , pleasure , and arousal . <S>
These findings will guide organizers to design strategies
that provide exciting experiences , as well as quality and satisfaction to the participants of sports events . <S> <P>
