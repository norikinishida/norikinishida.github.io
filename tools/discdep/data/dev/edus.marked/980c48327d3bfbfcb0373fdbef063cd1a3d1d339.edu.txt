Pathology practice is increasingly augmented with molecular tests for improved diagnostics and patient management . <S>
The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is foremost amongst these techniques . <S>
This review explains the principles of PCR and the methodological factors
that contribute to a successful assay . <S>
Key PCR technique variations ,
such as reverse transcription ( RT)-PCR and quantitative real - time ( q ) PCR ,
are described
and an overview is provided
of how PCR products are analysed . <S>
The review includes examples of PCR usage in clinical practice for the detection of infectious and genetic diseases , for tumour diagnostics and in molecular forensic applications
such as specimen identity confirmation . <S> <P>
The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) is a method for the in vitro amplification of DNA sequences
and involves automated cycles of denaturation , annealing and extension or synthesis
using a thermocycler . <S>
PCR was conceived and developed in the early 1980s by Kary Mullis ,
who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the invention in 1993 . 1 <S>
The technique allows the sensitive detection and analysis of miniscule quantities of nucleic acids . <S>
PCR has become established as a routine method in pathology diagnostics
and has been adapted for the detection of infectious agents , mutations , translocations and gene amplifications , and for molecular forensic applications
including identity testing . <S>
This review covers the basics of the PCR assay ,
describes PCR method variations
and details current pathology applications . <S> <P>
