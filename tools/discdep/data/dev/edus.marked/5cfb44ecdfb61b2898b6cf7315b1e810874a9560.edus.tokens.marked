The 2019-nCoV outbreak has raised concern of global spread . <S>
While person - to - person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak ,
the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear . <S>
Here we present a simple approach
for determining
whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States ,
which would allow endemic transmission . <S>
As of February 7 , 2020 , the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission , rather than ongoing transmission . <S>
However , this conclusion can change
if pre - symptomatic cases resulting from human - to - human transmission have not yet been identified . <S> <P>
The 2019-nCoV outbreak is a global health risk ,
especially considering the number of patients
who have already died
after becoming infected in Wuhan , China . <S>
Many initial characterizations of the virus have focused on the basic reproduction number , R ,
which reflects the average number of infections
that each new infection causes in a susceptible population . <S>
Whenever R is greater than one ,
epidemic transition becomes possible
and within the Wuhan province , R has been estimated as high as 4.1 1 - 3 . <S> <P>
