Activation of the thrombotic and complement systems is the main recognition and effector mechanisms in the multiple adverse biological responses
triggered when biomaterials or therapeutic cells come into blood contact .
We have created a surface
which is auto - protective to human innate immunity
by combining three fundamentally different strategies ,
all developed by us previously ,
which have been shown to induce substantial , but incomplete hemocompatibility
when used separately .
In summary , we have conjugated a factor Hebinding peptide ; and an ADP - degrading enzyme ;
using a PEG linker on both material and cellular surfaces .
When exposed to human whole blood ,
factor H was specifically recruited to the modified surfaces
and inhibited complement attack .
In addition , activation of platelets and coagulation was efficiently attenuated ,
by degrading ADP .
Thus , by inhibiting thromboinflammation
using a multicomponent approach ,
we have created a hybrid surface with the potential to greatly reduce incompatibility reactions involving biomaterials and transplantation .
