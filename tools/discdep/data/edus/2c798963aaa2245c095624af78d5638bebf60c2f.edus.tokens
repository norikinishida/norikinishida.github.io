Air sampling as an aid to infection control is still in an experimental stage ,
as there is no consensus
about which air samplers and pathogen detection methods should be used ,
and what thresholds of specific pathogens in specific exposed populations ( staff , patients , or visitors ) constitutes a true clinical risk .
This case report used a button sampler , worn or held by staff or left free - standing in a fixed location , for environmental sampling around a child
who was chronically infected by a respiratory adenovirus ,
to determine whether there was any risk of secondary adenovirus infection to the staff managing the patient .
Despite multiple air samples taken on difference days ,
coinciding with high levels of adenovirus detectable in the child 's nasopharyngeal aspirates ( NPAs ) ,
none of the air samples contained any detectable adenovirus DNA
using a clinically validated diagnostic polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay .
Although highly sensitive , in - house PCR assays have been developed
to detect airborne pathogen RNA / DNA ,
it is still unclear what level of specific pathogen RNA / DNA constitutes a true clinical risk .
In this case , the absence of detectable airborne adenovirus DNA
using a conventional diagnostic assay
removed the requirement for staff to wear surgical masks and face visors
when they entered the child 's room .
No subsequent staff infections or outbreaks of adenovirus have so far been identified .
