The epidemic threshold of the susceptible - infected - recovered model is a boundary separating parameters
that permit epidemics from those that do not .
This threshold corresponds to parameters
where the system 's equilibrium becomes unstable .
Consequently , we use the average rate
at which deviations from the equilibrium shrink to define a distance to this threshold .
However , the vital dynamics of the host population may occur slowly
even when transmission is far from threshold levels .
Here , we show analytically
how such slow dynamics can prevent estimation of the distance to the threshold from fluctuations in the susceptible population .
Although these results are exact only in the limit of long - term observation of a large system ,
simulations show
that they still provide useful insight into systems with a range of population sizes , environmental noise and observation schemes .
Having established some guidelines about when estimates are accurate ,
we then illustrate
how multiple distance estimates can be used to estimate the rate of approach to the threshold .
The estimation approach is general
and may be applicable to zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) as well as vaccine - preventable diseases like measles .
