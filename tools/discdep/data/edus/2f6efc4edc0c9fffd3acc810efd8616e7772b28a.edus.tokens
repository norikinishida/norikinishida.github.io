The appearance of the novel betacoronavirus SARS - CoV-2 represents a major threat to human health ,
and its diffusion around the world is causing dramatic consequences .
The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS - CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules .
Specifically , comparative analyses of the structures of SARS - CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses , such as SARS - CoV , can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits
that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system .
Herein , we apply our recently developed energy - based methods for the prediction of antibodybinding epitopes and protein - protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain ( RBD ) of the Spike proteins from SARS - CoV-2 and SARS - CoV.
Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation ,
without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties .
Importantly , our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions
that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind / elicit antibodies .
These results provide a rational basis to the observation
that several SARS - CoV RDB - specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS - CoV-2 counterpart .
Furthermore , we correctly identify the region of SARS - CoV-2 RBD
that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells .
The data , sequences and structures
we present here
can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions .
