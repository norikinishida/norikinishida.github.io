Typical enteropathogenic E. coli ( tEPEC ) carries the highest hazard of death in children with diarrhea
and atypical EPEC ( aEPEC ) was recently identified as significantly associated with diarrheal mortality in kittens .
In both children and kittens there is a significant association between aEPEC burden and diarrheal disease ,
however the infection can be found in individuals with and without diarrhea .
It remains unclear to what extent , under what conditions , or by what mechanisms aEPEC serves as a primary pathogen in individuals with diarrhea .
It seems likely that a combination of host and bacterial factors enable aEPEC to cause disease in some individuals and not in others .
The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of aEPEC on intestinal function and diarrhea in kittens
following experimentally - induced carriage and the influence of a disrupted intestinal microbiota on disease susceptibility .
Results of this study identify aEPEC as a potential pathogen in kittens .
In the absence of disruption to the intestinal microbiota , kittens are resistant to clinical signs of aEPEC carriage
but demonstrate significant occult changes in intestinal absorption and permeability .
Antibiotic - induced disruption of the intestinal microbiota prior to infection increases subsequent intestinal water loss
as determined by % fecal wet weight .
Enrichment of the intestinal microbiota with a commensal member of the feline mucosa - associated microbiota , Enterococcus hirae , ameliorated the effects of aEPEC experimental infection on intestinal function and water loss .
These observations begin to unravel the mechanisms
by which aEPEC infection may be able to exploit susceptible hosts .
