Transshipment hub selection becomes increasingly important to the global logistics community .
From the perspectives of shippers and freight forwarders , a selection must align with cost control strategy and sustain service reliability across cooperative service providers .
This paper assesses the selection with the options of both sea and air transports , and from the influence of country of origin of the company .
Critical factors of transshipment hub selection , both qualitative and quantitative , are identified through focus group discussions .
Relative importance of these factors is determined
based on collective views of logistics stakeholders .
The competitiveness of transshipment hubs is then assessed
using an AHP approach .
Our analysis is based on the historical implementation of direct transportation link policy between Mainland China and Taiwan .
With this empirical work , the finding suggests
that even the spawn of other nearby ports with shorter transport distance and closer proximity to cargo sources , there remain overriding factors such as customs regulations & government policies and connectivity
that a transshipment hub is preferred .
