Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world .
Since the effectiveness of the only available tuberculosis vaccine , Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette - Gu√©rin ( BCG ) , is suboptimal ,
there is a strong demand to develop new tuberculosis vaccines .
As tuberculosis is an airborne disease ,
the intranasal route of vaccination might be preferable .
Live influenza virus vaccines might be considered as potential vectors for mucosal immunization against various viral or bacterial pathogens , including M. tuberculosis .
We generated several subtypes of attenuated recombinant influenza A viruses
expressing the 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target protein ( ESAT-6 ) of M. tuberculosis from the NS1 reading frame .
We were able to demonstrate the potency of influenza virus NS vectors to induce an M. tuberculosisspecific Th1 immune response in mice .
Moreover , intranasal immunization of mice and guinea pigs with such vectors induced protection against mycobacterial challenge , similar to that induced by BCG vaccination .
