The type II transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT activate influenza viruses and the SARS - coronavirus ( TMPRSS2 ) in cell culture
and may play an important role in viral spread and pathogenesis in the infected host .
However , it is at present largely unclear to what extent these proteases are expressed in viral target cells in human tissues .
Here , we show
that both HAT and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed with 2,6-linked sialic acids , the major receptor determinant of human influenza viruses , throughout the human respiratory tract .
Similarly , coexpression of ACE2 , the SARS - coronavirus receptor , and TMPRSS2 was frequently found in the upper and lower aerodigestive tract , with the exception of the vocal folds , epiglottis and trachea .
Finally , activation of influenza virus was conserved between human , avian and porcine TMPRSS2 ,
suggesting
that this protease might activate influenza virus in reservoir- , intermediate - and human hosts .
In sum , our results show
that TMPRSS2 and HAT are expressed by important influenza and SARS - coronavirus target cells
and could thus support viral spread in the human host .
