TREM2 variants have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and other neurodegenerative diseases ( NDDs ) .
Because TREM2 encodes a receptor exclusively expressed on immune cells ,
identification of these variants conclusively demonstrates
that the immune response can play an active role in the pathogenesis of NDDs .
These TREM2 variants also confer the highest risk for developing Alzheimer 's disease of any risk factor identified in nearly two decades ,
suggesting
that understanding more about TREM2 function could provide key insights into NDD pathology
and provide avenues for novel immune - related NDD biomarkers and therapeutics .
The expression , signaling and function of TREM2 in NDDs have been extensively investigated in an effort
to understand the role of immune function in disease pathogenesis and progression .
We provide a comprehensive review of our current understanding of TREM2 biology ,
including new insights into the regulation of TREM2 expression , and TREM2 signaling and function across NDDs .
While many open questions remain ,
the current body of literature provides clarity on several issues .
While it is still often cited
that TREM2 expression is decreased by pro - inflammatory stimuli ,
it is now clear that this is true in vitro ,
but inflammatory stimuli in vivo almost universally increase TREM2 expression .
Likewise , while TREM2 function is classically described as promoting an anti - inflammatory phenotype ,
more than half of published studies demonstrate a pro - inflammatory role for TREM2 ,
suggesting
that its role in inflammation is much more complex .
Finally , these components of TREM2 biology are applied to a discussion
of how TREM2 impacts NDD pathologies
and the latest assessment
of how these findings might be applied to immune - directed clinical biomarkers and therapeutics .
