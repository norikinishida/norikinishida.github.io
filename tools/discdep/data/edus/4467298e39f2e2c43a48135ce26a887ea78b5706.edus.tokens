The ultimate goal of proteomics is to identify biologically active proteins and to produce them
using biotechnology tools such as bacterial hosts .
However , proteins
produced by Escherichia coli
must be refolded to their native state .
Protein folding liquid chromatography ( PFLC ) is a new method
developed in recent years ,
and it is widely used in molecular biology and biotechnology .
In this paper , the new method , PFLC is introduced
and its recent development is reviewed .
In addition the paper includes definitions , advantages , principles , applications for both laboratory and large scales , apparatus , and effecting factors of PFLC .
In addition , the role of this method in the future is examined .
