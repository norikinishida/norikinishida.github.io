The early detection of SARS - CoV-2 , the causative agent of ( COVID-19 ) is now a critical task for the clinical practitioners .
The COVID-19 spread is announced as pandemic outbreak between people worldwide by WHO since 11/ March/ 2020 .
In this consequence , it is top critical priority to become aware of the infected people
so that prevention procedures can be processed
to minimize the COVID-19 spread
and to begin early medical health care of those infected persons .
In this paper , the deep studying based totally methodology is usually recommended for the detection of COVID-19 infected patients
using X - ray images .
The help vector gadget classifies the corona affected X - ray images from others through usage of the deep features .
The technique is useful for the clinical practitioners for early detection of COVID-19 infected patients .
The suggested system of multi - level thresholding plus SVM presented high accuracy in classification of the infected lung with Covid-19 .
All images were of the same size
and stored in JPEG format with 512 * 512 pixels .
The average sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of the lung classification
using the proposed model results
were 95.76 % , 99.7 % , and 97.48 % , respectively .
