As intracellular parasites , viruses require a host cell in order to replicate .
However , they face a series of cellular responses against infection .
One of these responses is the activation of the double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA)-activated protein kinase R ( PKR ) .
PKR phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 ( eIF2α ) ,
which in turn results in global protein synthesis inhibition and formation of stress granules ( SGs ) .
Recent studies have shown that SGs can interfere with the replicative cycle of certain viruses .
This review addresses
how viruses have evolved different control strategies at the SG level
to ensure an efficient replication cycle during the cellular stress response triggered by the viral infection .
