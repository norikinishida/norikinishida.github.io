Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) spread globally in early 2020 ,
causing the world to face an existential health crisis .
Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography ( CT ) images offers a great potential
to augment the traditional healthcare strategy
for tackling COVID-19 .
However , segmenting infected regions from CT scans faces several challenges ,
including high variation in infection characteristics , and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues .
Further , collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period ,
inhibiting the training of a deep model .
To address these challenges ,
a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network ( Inf - Net ) is proposed
to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT scans .
In our Inf - Net , a parallel partial decoder is used
to aggregate the high - level features
and generate a global map .
Then , the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge - attention are utilized
to model the boundaries
and enhance the representations .
Moreover ,
to alleviate the shortage of labeled data ,
we present a semi - supervised segmentation framework
based on a randomly selected propagation strategy ,
which only requires a few labeled images
and leverages primarily unlabeled data .
Our semi - supervised framework can improve the learning ability
and achieve a higher performance .
Extensive experiments on our COVID - SemiSeg and and real CT volumes demonstrate
that the proposed Inf - Net outperforms most cutting - edge segmentation models
and advances the state - of - theart performance .
