In general , a whole virion serves as a simple vaccine antigen and often essential material for the analysis of immune responses against virus infection .
However ,
to work with highly contagious pathogens ,
it is necessary to take precautions against laboratory - acquired infection .
We have learned many lessons from the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) .
In order to develop an effective vaccine and diagnostic tools ,
we prepared UV - inactivated SARS coronavirus on a large scale under the strict Biosafety Level 3 ( BSL3 ) regulation .
Our protocol for large - scale preparation of UV - inactivated SARS - CoV
including virus expansion , titration , inactivation , and ultracentrifugation
is applicable to any newly emerging virus
we might encounter in the future .
