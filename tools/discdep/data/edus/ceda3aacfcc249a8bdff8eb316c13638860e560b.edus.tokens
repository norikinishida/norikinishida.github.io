I use the COVID-19 death rate in South Korea and a method relating the ratio of death rates in a U.S. state to its share of cumulative positive tests
to estimate the total cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.
and to estimate the extent of infection and the unidentified share of the infected population in each of the lower-48 states and in New York City in mid - April , 2020 .
I identify a logarithmic relationship between the cumulative death rate in a state and its cumulative positive share of tests .
Using this relationship ,
I find
that 4.3 - 5.4 million people , 1.4 - 1.7 % of the U.S. population , were infected , with rates of infection
that ranged from 0.1 % in more rural states to 8 - 10 % in New York state and 11 - 13 % in New York City .
Only 16 - 20 % of these infected individuals were identified later through testing .
