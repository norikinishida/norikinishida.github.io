Bird to human transmission of high pathogenicity avian influenza virus ( HPAIV ) poses a significant risk of triggering a flu pandemic in the human population .
Therefore , vaccination of susceptible poultry during an HPAIV outbreak might be the best remedy
to prevent such transmissions .
To this end , suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method
that can be translated to field settings
needs to be developed .
Our previous study in chickens has shown
that inhalation of a non - adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge .
The aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination
by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants .
Two adjuvants , namely , Bacterium - like Particles ( BLP ) and Advax , were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations .
Delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed
that BLP and Advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both .
Upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set - up , BLP and Advax / BLP adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the nonadjuvanted formulation .
Remarkably , all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge ,
but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the Advax group .
Overall , our results indicate
that passive inhalation is feasible , effective and suitable for mass vaccination of chickens
if it can be adapted to field settings .
