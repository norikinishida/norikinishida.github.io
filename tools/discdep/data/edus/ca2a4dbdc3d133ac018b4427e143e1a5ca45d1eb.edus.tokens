The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus has , as of 20 th of April 2020 , reached most countries of the world .
In an effort to design informed public health policies , many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest , including ICU solicitation , cumulated death counts , etc â€¦
The corresponding data analyses however , mostly rely on restricted ( openly available ) data sources ,
which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series .
In addition , many of these predictions are derived
before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet ( as is still currently the case for many countries ) .
In this work , we show
that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions .
Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics ,
our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models ,
which are variants of the socalled " Susceptible - Infected - Removed " or SIR framework .
Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models
that currently inform public health policies .
They also motivate a plea for gathering and opening richer and more reliable data time series ( e.g. , ICU occupancy , negative test rates , social distancing commitment reports , etc ) .
