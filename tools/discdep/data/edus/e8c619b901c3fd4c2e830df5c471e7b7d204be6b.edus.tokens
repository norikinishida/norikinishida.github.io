An increasing body of evidence highlights the role of host genetic variation in driving susceptibility to severe disease following pathogen infection .
In order to fully appreciate the importance of host genetics on infection susceptibility and resulting disease ,
genetically variable experimental model systems should be employed .
These systems allow for the identification , characterization , and mechanistic dissection of genetic variants
that cause differential disease responses .
Herein we discuss application of the Collaborative Cross ( CC ) panel of recombinant inbred strains to study viral pathogenesis ,
focusing on practical considerations for experimental design , assessment and analysis of disease responses within the CC , as well as some of the resources developed for the CC .
Although the focus of this chapter is on viral pathogenesis ,
many of the methods presented within are applicable to studies of other pathogens , as well as to case - control designs in genetically diverse populations .
