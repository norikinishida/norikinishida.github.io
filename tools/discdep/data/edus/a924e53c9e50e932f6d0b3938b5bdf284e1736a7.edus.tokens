Apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral infections .
In this study , we investigated the cell death processes during productive HHV-6A infection and the underlying mechanisms .
Annexin V - PI staining and electron microscopy indicated
that HHV-6A is a strong inducer of apoptosis .
HHV-6A infection decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential
and led to morphological changes of mitochondria .
The cell death was associated with activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of DNA repair enzyme poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ,
which is known to be an important substrate for activated caspase-3 .
Caspase-9 was activated significantly in HHV-6Ainfected cells ,
whereas caspase-8 was not activated obviously .
Moreover , HHV-6A infection upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2 .
This is the first demonstration of mitochondrion - mediated , caspase - dependent apoptosis in HHV-6A - infected cells .
